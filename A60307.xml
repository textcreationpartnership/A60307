            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:57574:3"/>the Series of this Hi≈øtory, it is fully and at large di≈øcour≈øed; not ≈øo only, but the <hi>Turks</hi> various Succe≈ø≈øes in their Wars at Land and Sea; Including their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Cu≈øtoms, Manners, and extent of that Empire, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains at this day; being dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the Original of the fir≈øt and ≈øecond Empire, for the ≈øpace of ≈øix hundred years, attended with Circum≈øtances too tedious here to be recited.

               <p>This defeat inraged the Sultan, and cau≈øed him to ≈øend an Army double the number of the former under the Conduct of <hi>Humbramy-Alim</hi> his other Brother, who after ≈øix days Siege took <hi>Arzen</hi> a Town rich in Merchandize, but the Lievtenant having joyned his Forces with tho≈øe of <hi>Liperates</hi> Governour of <hi>Iberia,</hi> who came to his A≈ø≈øi≈øtance, the Battle was joyned, which continued bloody and doubtful for the ≈øpace of four hours, at the end of which the Victory fell to the Chri≈øtians, who followed the Execution till Night put an end to it, yet <hi>Liperates</hi> fighting valiantly was taken and carried into <hi>Per≈øia,</hi> for who≈øe Ran≈øom the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ≈øent great Pre≈øents; but the Sultan out of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous bravery ≈øent him home Ran≈øom-free, only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moni≈øhing never to bear Arms again≈øt him more, and with him ≈øent <hi>Seriph</hi> a Mahumetan Prie≈øt as his Amba≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øador, to demand of the Emperor that he would become Tributary to the Sultan, and that thereby an Eternal Peace might i≈ø≈øue, which the Emperor rejected with ju≈øt di≈ødain.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57574:32"/>put them to flight, recovering the Booty and Pri≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, at which time the City of <hi>Hierapolis</hi> was ≈øurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to him, and many other Cities which the <hi>Turks</hi> had taken; and then dividing his Army, pa≈øt on with one part of it to <hi>Syria,</hi> and left the other part to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the new Conque≈øt, which in his ab≈øence was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the <hi>Turks,</hi> upon News of which the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Aleppo</hi> revolted from him. But whil≈øt the <hi>Turks</hi> ≈øuppo≈øed they had him in a Toil, he without any noi≈øe fell in with their Army and put them to flight, making great ≈ølaughter of ≈øuch as fled, and then receiving the Homage of the ≈øeveral Countries he pa≈ø≈øed through, he came to <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Caelicia,</hi> and there quartered his Army, and ≈øo returned to <hi>Con≈øtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperor having recruited him≈øelf all Winter, early in the Spring ha≈øted to his Army to oppo≈øe the <hi>Turks</hi> that were abroad ravaging the Country about new <hi>Cae≈øaria,</hi> and after having repre≈ø≈øed them pa≈ø≈øed on to the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> where leaving part of his Army with his Lievtenant for ≈øecuring the Frontires, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into <hi>Capadocia;</hi> but in his ab≈øence his Lievtenant was routed by the Turki≈øh Army which the Emperor under≈øtanding at <hi>Sabestia,</hi> he ≈øent the Governour of <hi>Antioch</hi> with part of his Army to oppo≈øe them at <hi>Mop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiphestia,</hi> but they before were broken by the <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who had took from them the rich Booties they had acquired by the Sacks of many Cities.</p>

               <p>With this overthrow of his Men, <hi>Amurath</hi> was greatly inraged, and gathering all his Power marched into <hi>Servia</hi> (which before he had Relinqui≈øhed upon the De≈øpots becoming his Tributary) where he found the <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> with a formidable Army ready to receive him; when after ≈øome Towns and Ca≈øtles taken, on either ≈øide, both Armies met upon the great Plains of <hi>Co≈ø≈øovia,</hi> where when the Captains on either ≈øide had put their Men in Order; exhorting them to do their be≈øt for obtaining the Victory, they joyned with ≈øuch Fury that the Earth trembled under their Feet, and ≈øuch was the horrid noi≈øe of Cla≈øhing Arms, ≈øhouts of the Conquerors Cries, of the Vanqui≈øhed and Weeing of Hor≈øes, that wild Bea≈øts in the Mountains trembled; and tho≈øe that beheld the Fight ≈øuppo≈øed that ≈øhowers of Arrows de≈øcended from the Clouds.

               <p>
                  <hi>BAjazet</hi> a man of a Proud and haughty temper, having taken upon him the Regency of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Kingdoms, fell heavily upon <hi>Servia,</hi> not ≈øo much as vouch≈øafing to hear the Emba≈ø≈øadors ≈øent on their behalf, which made the Princes of the We≈øt begin to con≈øider their own e≈øtate, and e≈øpecially <hi>Vincelaus</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Emperor, and <hi>Sigi≈ømond</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and not contented with the ≈øpiols of <hi>Servia,</hi> he made ≈øeveral inroads into <hi>Bo≈øan,</hi> ≈øpoiling the Country and carrying away great booties, when in the mean while the King of <hi>Caramania</hi> hearing of his Fathers death, began anew to wa≈øte his Countries in <hi>A≈øia,</hi> which cau≈øed <hi>Bajazet</hi> to ≈øend a great power, who overthrew him and recovered all that was lo≈øt taking from him likewi≈øe his own Country which obliged him in humble wi≈øe to beg their re≈øtauration, which <hi>Bajazet</hi> upon condition that he ≈øhould from that time forward become his va≈ø≈øal re≈øtored.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> the only City the <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> had in <hi>A≈øia,</hi> was be≈øieged by <hi>Bajazets</hi> Power, and after a ≈øtraight Siege and no hopes of any ≈øuccours, delivered by the Citizens as a ran≈øom for their Lives and Per≈øons.</p>
               <p>Having ≈øubdued <hi>Servia,</hi> and the greate≈øt part of <hi>Bo≈øan,</hi> he invaded <hi>The≈ø≈øalia</hi> wa≈øting it as he pa≈ø≈øed with fire and Sword, even to the Walls of <hi>The≈ø≈øalonica,</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:57574:69"/>taking <hi>Neopolis</hi> in <hi>Greece;</hi> and <hi>Joannia</hi> in <hi>Aetolia,</hi> and afterward returning into <hi>A≈øia</hi> he there ≈øpent the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but Spring being come, with all his Power he repa≈ø≈øed the <hi>Helle≈øpont,</hi> and lay'd clo≈øe Siege to <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> the ≈øeat of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel Paleologus</hi> then Reigning, who after he had been brought to great extremity, went to the <hi>German</hi> Emperors Court to crave aid, who together with many other <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> Princes, ≈øent an Army of 250000 under the leading of young <hi>Sigi≈ømond</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> to oppo≈øe whom <hi>Bajazet</hi> rai≈øed his Siege and found them be≈øieging <hi>Neocopolis;</hi> from whence they drew into the great Plain and joyned Battle, but by rea≈øon of the confu≈øion that was in the <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> Army, their Van being overcharged, the Rear fled without ≈øtriking a ≈øtroak, ≈øo that the <hi>Turks</hi> getting the Victory with a far le≈øs number pur≈øued ≈øo hard upon the <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> that the greater part of the Army was ≈ølain, taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoners and drowned in pa≈ø≈øing the River <hi>Danu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this great and unexpected Victory over the <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> occa≈øioned by the emulation that aro≈øe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt their great Commanders, <hi>Bajazet</hi> returned to the Siege of <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> now out of all hope to be relieved, where whil≈øt he lay ca≈øting his eyes upon <hi>De≈øpina,</hi> the ≈ølain <hi>De≈øpot</hi> of <hi>Servia</hi>'s fair Daughter, offered by her Mother; his former Wife being dead he Married her, and for her ≈øake re≈øtored to her Brother <hi>Stephen</hi> all his fathers Principalities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aladin</hi> the <hi>Carramanian</hi> King being dead, and his Son of the ≈øame name Reigning in his ≈øtead, de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to revenge the wrong <hi>Bajazet</hi> had done his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Subjects, coming to <hi>Aucyra</hi> ≈øurpri≈øed <hi>Temurta≈ø≈øes Bajazet</hi>'s great Lievtenant, but upon the approach of <hi>Bajazet</hi> with his Army he richly arraying begged his pardon, and ≈øet him at liberty, ≈øending Emba≈ø≈øadors to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57574:70"/>excu≈øe them; but <hi>Bajazet</hi> would not ≈øuffer them to come into his ≈øight, whereupon the young King gathering all the Power of his Country, fought with him a great Battle, but being far too weak for ≈øuch an Enemy was overthrown &amp; he taken Pri≈øoner, &amp; by the Command of <hi>Bajazet</hi> delivered to <hi>Temurta≈øes</hi> his Capital Enemy, who for the di≈øgrace he had put upon him cau≈øed him to be ≈øtrangled, which ra≈øh deed much grieved <hi>Bajazet,</hi> the young Prince being his Si≈øters Son, yet he ≈øeized upon the greate≈øt part of his Kingdom, though he had ≈øeveral Sons living, and ≈øo inraged was he that he expul≈øed all the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Princes in Le≈ø≈øer <hi>A≈øia,</hi> and ≈øeized upon their Territories, whereupon they fled to <hi>Tamerlane</hi> the Great, who having Married the daughter of the Cham or Emperor of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and now returned from the Conque≈øt of <hi>China,</hi> he took them into his protection, and being at the ≈øame time Solicited for aid by <hi>Emanuel</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, he ≈øent to <hi>Bajazet</hi> his Emba≈ø≈øadors, with many rich pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øents, reque≈øting him to cea≈øe from mole≈øting his Allies, but he in a proud manner not only rejected his pre≈øents, but with many opprobrious words, ca≈øt foul reproaches on him, telling his Emba≈ø≈øadors that he de≈øired nothing more then to meet him in the field, and with many taunting expre≈ø≈øions di≈ømi≈ø≈øed them. The report of which ≈øo throughly netled the <hi>Tartar,</hi> that he re≈øolved with a pui≈ø≈øant Army to go again≈øt him, being hightened thereto by <hi>Axalla</hi> his great favourite, a <hi>Genoway</hi> by birth, and friend to the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, who≈øe cau≈øe he daily ≈øolicited. And <hi>Tamerlane</hi> who was a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øher to the <hi>Chri≈øtians,</hi> in his opinion differing little from them ≈øo well approved of all he ≈øaid, and having taken his leave of his Father-in-Law, and his Wife, with a powerful Army he pa≈ø≈øed the Mountains, March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through many Countries, none daring oppo≈øe his pa≈ø≈øage, till at length coming to <hi>Bachichich,</hi> he mu≈øtered
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57574:70"/>his Army, and found it to con≈øi≈øt of 800000 Hor≈øe and Foot of divers Nations, to whom he gave gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pay, not having ≈øuffered the lea≈øt wrong to be done in any Country, through which he had pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> lying at the Siege of <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> and hearing the <hi>Tartar</hi> approached with a Power that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Countries as he pa≈ø≈øed, he rai≈øed his Siege, and contrary to <hi>Tamerlains</hi> Expectation, but even as he wi≈øhed, came over with ≈øuch forces as he could rai≈øe, into <hi>A≈øia;</hi> where he joyned with his Livete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whil≈øt the <hi>Tartars</hi> ≈øtill came on, having by this time pa≈ø≈øed <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and taken all the Cities in their way, that appertained to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and among≈øt the re≈øt the great City of <hi>Saba≈øtia,</hi> once the chief Seat of the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Sultan, utterly ra≈øing it, putting all the Citizens to the Sword, or as ≈øome, Buryed them alive in deep Pits he cau≈øed to be digged for that purpo≈øe, unle≈øs the Governour whom he ≈øet at Liberty to carry the News to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing 500000 Strong, who upon the Governours coming into his pre≈øence, demanded which was the greater Army he having ≈øeen both, to which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having craved pardon, he replyed that the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> Army mu≈øt needs be the greate≈øt: by Rea≈øon he was Lord of far greater Countries; whereupon <hi>Bajazet</hi> Laughing, ≈øaid out of doubt the ≈øight of the <hi>Tartars</hi> hath made this Coward ≈øo affraid, that he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every Enemy two.</p>
               <p>The Armies being come near to each other upon the great Plains of <hi>Sennas,</hi> he thought not good to joyn Battle pre≈øently by Rea≈øon the Evening ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached; yet many light Skirmi≈øhes happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Parthian</hi> Hor≈øemen, and the Forerunners of the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Army; but the next Morning either Hoa≈øt being ≈øet in Array, after ≈øome Pau≈øe the charge
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57574:71"/>was Sounded, whereupon the Prince of <hi>Ciarcan Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marlin</hi>'s Kin≈ø-man, with 40000 Hor≈øe charged the <hi>Turks</hi> in the Front, and Piercing their Battle, put the <hi>Jannizaries</hi> into di≈øorder; but venturing too far was there Slain, whereupon <hi>Axalla</hi> Leading the Vaunt-Guard compo≈øed of <hi>Sciths</hi> and <hi>Parthians,</hi> bore upon the left Wing of the <hi>Turks</hi> Army, cutting in pieces and Bearing down all that oppos'd him, at what time his Footmen coming to joyn with him he Faced the <hi>Batalion</hi> of the <hi>Jnnaizaries;</hi> who behaved them≈øelves Valiantly for the ≈øafety of their Prince, who in the middle of them Fought on Foot, which Fight continued Bloody, and doubtful for the ≈øpace of an Hour, all the place being heaped with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Slain; till at la≈øt the <hi>Tartars</hi> being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged gave Ground, which <hi>Tamerlain</hi> from his Stand perceiving ≈øent 10000 Hor≈øe to Reinforce them, and other 10000 to Fight in the Rearward, and at the ≈øame time ≈øent his Foot-men, who fell in with the <hi>Turks</hi> main Battle that remained yet un≈øhaken with ≈øuch fury, that making them give way, he opened them to the Rear of the <hi>Jannizaries;</hi> wherein was yet the Per≈øon of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who ≈øu≈øtained the greate≈øt Brunt of the Fight, but at la≈øt overpowered with number, they were forced to give Gronnd, at what time <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlain</hi> coming on with 50000 fre≈øh Hor≈øe, Bore down all before him till he came to the <hi>Jannizaries</hi> (who always Fight in the Heart of the Army) and they weary, and not able to make ≈øufficient re≈øi≈øtance, were trodden down on all ≈øides, ≈øo that the Battle Swer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, the <hi>Turks</hi> betook them≈øelves to Flight, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt the re≈øt <hi>Bajazet</hi> wounded as he was, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards fell into the Hands of <hi>Axalla,</hi> together with his Son <hi>Mu≈øa.</hi> The De≈øpot of <hi>Servia</hi> and many others of note.</p>
               <p>This great Victory fell to the <hi>Tartars</hi> chiefly, by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57574:71"/>the revolt of a great number of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s men; who were rai≈øed in the Countries of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Princes expul≈øed, who in the Heat of the Battle, ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their natural Lords under <hi>Tamerline</hi>'s Standard went over to 'um.</p>
               <p>This Fight la≈øted Bloody and doubtful from Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Morning till four in the Evening, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as many report 200000 on either ≈øide were Slain, and among≈øt the re≈øt <hi>Mu≈øtapha Bajazets</hi> Son with mo≈øt of his great Commanders.</p>
               <p>After this <hi>Bajazet</hi> being brought before <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> and demanded why he oppre≈ø≈øed the Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and made War upon ≈øo Noble a Prince as was the Emperor of <hi>Greece;</hi> to which he replyed, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the ≈øame thing that hath moved thee to invade me, even the de≈øire of Glory and Soveraignty; and why, ≈øaid <hi>Tamerlain,</hi> do you u≈øe ≈øuch Tyranny over tho≈øe you Conquer without Re≈øpect of Sex or Age?

I would, ≈øaid the haughty <hi>Turk</hi> (not Conquered tho overcome) have put thee in a Cage of Iron, and have carryed thee in Triumph about my Kingdom. Even ≈øo ≈øaid <hi>Tamerlain,</hi> ≈øhalt thou be ≈øerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thereupon commanded him out of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, and as he had determined, ≈øhortly after Coop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him up in a Cage of Iron, and carryed him into the Countries he Conquered, who≈øe Calamity may well ≈øerve as a memento to all a≈øpiring Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, by putting them in mind that the Worldly Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not perminent.</p>
               <p>After this the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor ≈øent his Amba≈ø≈øedor to <hi>Tamerlain</hi> in his Name, to deliver up his City and Empire; but he refu≈øed, ≈øaying he had Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ≈øufficient of his own, and after having ≈øeen

But one <hi>Prelat</hi> a Valiant Captain being Governour, right Manfully defended it, in≈øomuch that in the frequent A≈ø≈øaults made he lo≈øt 20000 of his be≈øt men, yet being a≈øhamed to rai≈øe his Siege 'ere he had won the City, ≈øent to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer terms of Peace with great Priviledges and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, if they ≈øurrender'd the place, as likewi≈øe by ≈øecret means indeavoured to corrupt the Captains with great promi≈øes; but they dete≈øting his offer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded more their Loyalty to their Prince then his Gold, yet at the ≈øame time there wanted not one ba≈øe minded Vallain, who for a Sum in Hand and other large offers, when he had performed his promi≈øe, undertook to deliver the City into the Hands of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath;</hi> which by this means he effected.</p>
               <p>This great City ≈øtanding upon a Rock, had in it but one Well, which ≈øerved both the Soldiers and Citizens plentifully with Water, into this Well did the Villain by occupation a Smith ca≈øt the Carkas of a ≈øtinking Dog, which the next Morning found by ≈øome of the Soldiers, and drawn thence the rumour thereof was quickly ≈øpread throughout, whereupon the Soldiers notwith≈øtanding all the intreaties of the Governour and chief Citizens, the Soldiers would not be per≈øwaded to Drink thereof, re≈øolving rather to indure the wor≈øt Extremity; and by this means the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57574:82"/>City not being tenable, the Governor to prevent a mutiny among≈øt his Soldiers, and the danger the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was in to be ≈øacked, ≈øent to <hi>Amurath</hi> to acquaint him, that upon condition the Garri≈øon might pa≈øs with Bag and Baggage to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and the Citizens live peaceably, he would deliver him the City; who being glad of this offer freely granted their demand, only with this condition, that the Citizens ≈øhould build their Hou≈øes without the City.</p>
               <p>The≈øe Articles agreed on, the City was delivered to <hi>Amurath,</hi> and the Traytor by who≈øe means it was ≈øurrendered, was rewarded with three rich Suits of Apparel, 50000 A≈øpers, and the promi≈øe of a yearly Pen≈øion of 2000 Ducats; but long he had not enjoyed his riches 'ere he received a ju≈øter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his Trea≈øon; being, as 'tis ≈øaid, ≈øecretly made away by the command of <hi>Amurath,</hi> who tho he loved the Trea≈øon, abhorred the Traytor.</p>
               <p>The City being thus gained, <hi>Amurath</hi> having furni≈øhed it with a Garri≈øon of his be≈øt men, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with the re≈øt of his Army to <hi>Hadrianople,</hi> upon the Rear of which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ≈øetting with 8000 Hor≈øe and 3000 Foot, cut off a great part of his Army. And having followed quite out of his Territories, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Croia,</hi> and fortified it, upon notice that <hi>Amurath</hi> intended to return with his Army in the Spring, in which he was not deceived; for the old <hi>Turk</hi> de≈øirous to ≈øubdue the Country of <hi>Epirus,</hi> to obliterate the di≈øgrace he had received by the many overthrows he had there received, he ≈øent <hi>Sebahyas</hi> one of his <hi>Ba≈ø≈øas</hi> before with part of his Army; him≈øelf following ≈ølowly with the re≈øt, and upon his arrival ≈øat down before the great City of <hi>Croia,</hi> where having ca≈øt 10 Pieces of Cannon, he began to batter it, the which with great fury he continued to do for the ≈øpace of 4 Days in two places, beating down part
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57574:82"/>of the Wall, upon which he commanded the A≈ø≈øault to be given, thru≈øting his men de≈øperately into the Breach, giving order that ≈øuch as Shrunk ≈øhould be killed by their Fellows, and on the other ≈øide pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øing them great reward, if they entered the City, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> his Son being then in the Camp, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding as General promi≈øed 100000 A≈øpers to him that ≈øhould fir≈øt advance his En≈øign upon the Wall; but neither prevailed, for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ranacontes</hi> the Governour, a Valiant man incouraging his Soldiers, gave the <hi>Turks</hi> ≈øuch a Welcome, that they left 8000 of their dead Bodies in the Breach, Ditches and Plains adjacent; which <hi>Amurath</hi> perceiving and under≈øtanding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible courage of the <hi>Epirots,</hi> cau≈øed the retreat to be ≈øounded, and after many repul≈øes and no hopes of prevailing, he fell to his old practice, endeavouring to corrupt the Governour, and chief Captains with large Gifts, and to that end ≈øent a Crafty <hi>Ba≈ø≈øa,</hi> with two Servants Loaded with Trea≈øure; which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour with di≈ødain rejected, Vowing that if the like were attempted again, that he would cau≈øe the Hands, No≈øes and Ears of the Me≈ø≈øengers to be cut off, and they ≈øo returned to their Ma≈øter.</p>
               <p>During this Siege, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was not Idle but ≈øtill hovered about the <hi>Turks</hi> Camp, frequently Alarum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'um, and breaking into one Quarter, or other, killing tho≈øe that Guarded it, and taking great Booties, in≈øomuch that after ≈øeveral Months Siege, and the lo≈øs of 30000 men, <hi>Amurath</hi> through Grief and de≈øpair Dyed in his Tent <hi>Anno</hi> 1450, in the 85 Year of his Age, and of his Reign the 28, or as ≈øome ≈øay, the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth, leaving <hi>Mahomet</hi> his Son to ≈øucceed him in his trouble≈øome Kingdom, charging him to revenge his Death upon <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and ≈øo having his Corps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to <hi>Pru≈øa,</hi> he was there interred by his Ance≈øtors.</p>

               <p>A <hi>Murath</hi> being dead <hi>Mahomet</hi> the ≈øecond began his Reign over the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Kingdom, <hi>Anno</hi> 1450. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a firey Cruel Nature, given to many Debauches, not acknowledging any Deity, but a≈øcribing all things to Fortune and Chance; who, e'r he was well ≈øettled, cau≈øed his two Brethren, the one an Infant, and the other not above twelve years of Age, to be put to Death; after which he fell to altering the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution of the Government, by abrogating the Old Laws, and E≈øtabli≈øhing new ones more ≈øuitable to his Humour: So that he began to be exceedingly hated by his Subjects, when to prevent any di≈øorder that might happen by the Soldiers lying Idle, he hearing that <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim</hi> King of <hi>Carramania</hi> was entered his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the le≈ø≈øer <hi>A≈øia,</hi> pa≈ø≈øed thither, upon who≈øe Arrival the King unable to oppo≈øe him, fled into the Mountains, and from thence ≈øent his Amba≈ø≈øadors to treat with him, who offered ≈øuch Submi≈ø≈øion in the behalf of their Ma≈øters, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> was well Content to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and ≈øo returned to his City of <hi>Pru≈øa,</hi> ≈øending <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaac Ba≈ø≈øa,</hi> again≈øt <hi>Elias</hi> Prince of <hi>Mente≈øia,</hi> or <hi>Caria,</hi> who altogether deprived the ≈øaid Prince of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, annexing it to the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Empire, for ≈øo hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth I mu≈øt call it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mahomet</hi> being proud of his Petty Conque≈øts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Colour or Rea≈øon, only being driven Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57574:83"/>by Ambition; he re≈øolved to make War upon the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, and to have the ≈øooner done, marched to the Walls of <hi>Constantinople</hi> with a great Power, laying Siege to that Imperial City, which had once been Mi≈øtre≈øs of the World, which he reduced to ≈øuch Extremity, that the Citizens for meer Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger left no filthy thing uneaten, and at la≈øt Eat one another; and perceiving none intended to relieve them, they inforced by invincible nece≈ø≈øity yielded the faire≈øt City of the World, to the Will of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, having made all the defence that from true Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour could be expected.</p>
               <p>The proud Conqueror entering the City, amid≈øt his Cups cau≈øed all the <hi>Grecian</hi> Nobility, the chief Citizens and Nobles of other Nations to be ≈ølain in his Pre≈øence. <hi>Constantinus Paleologus</hi> the Emperor being before ≈ølain and Trampled underfoot in the Pre≈øs, as he was indeavouring to e≈øcape the Imperial City; this taken after a years Siege, <hi>Pera</hi> a City of the <hi>Greeks</hi> oppo≈øite to it ≈øurrendred, yet were the Citizens u≈øed with all manner of De≈øpite: And now removing the Imperial Seat from <hi>Hadrianople</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where it has ever ≈øince remain'd, he repaired the Walls, and ≈øuch Buildings, as had been demoli≈øhed by the Fury of the Cannon.</p>
               <p>Among≈øt the Captives taken in the City, one of his Commanders pre≈øented unto him one of the mo≈øt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Ladies that Nature ever formed, named <hi>Irene,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nobly de≈øcended; and for Education not to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralell'd, upon this incomparable Beauty, <hi>Mahomet</hi> ≈øo doted, that he ≈øpent whole Days and Nights with her, never thinking his time well ≈øpent but in her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: So that his warlike Affairs were altogether neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, which cau≈øed his Captains to murmur again≈øt him, though they dur≈øt not freely ≈øpeak their Minds, which <hi>Mu≈øtapha Ba≈ø≈øa,</hi> one that had been bred up

               <p>At this free Speech of the <hi>Ba≈ø≈øas, Mahomet</hi> was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully offended, telling him he was worthy of Death for his un≈øea≈øonable Pre≈øumption; but notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he would pardon him for the good Opinion he had of his Fidelity, Commanding him the next Morning to a≈ø≈øemble all his Captains, and chief Councellors the next Morning to attend his Plea≈øure in his Pallace; which being accordingly done, he came out of his Chamber, leading the fair <hi>Greek</hi> in mo≈øt ≈øplendid At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, which adding Lu≈øter to her rare Perfections, made her appear more like an Angel then a Mortal; and ≈øternly demanding of them, Whether if any of them had ≈øuch an ine≈øtimable Trea≈øure, they would not be thrice advi≈øed e'r they parted with it: To which they all an≈øwered, that he had with greater rea≈øon pa≈ø≈øed his time with her, then any man had to find ≈øault therewith.

               <p>During this preparation of the Chri≈øtians the Turks were not idle, but calling a Council of the chief Commanders held a long debate, whether they ≈øhould give the Chri≈øtians Battle, or decline it, but at length tho≈øe that held it dangerous to give Battle being over-ballanced by tho≈øe that were of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, it was re≈øolved that the whole Fleet ≈øhould be put in order of Battle, which at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Haly</hi> Ba≈ø≈øa, General of the Land Forces, and Great Admiral of the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Gallies, coming out of the Bay of <hi>Corinth</hi> or <hi>Lepanto,</hi> they were put into order of the Battle after this manner.

               <p>Both Fleets being ≈øet in order of Battle, about
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57574:158"/>noon a fierce <hi>ingagement</hi> happened in the beginning of which God ≈øo ordering it, the Wind turned about to the great advantage of the Chri≈øtians, driving the ≈ømoake of the great Ordnance, and vollies of ≈ømall ≈øhot in the face of the Infidels, whereupon for a long time the fight continued with equal ≈øucce≈øs, victory inclining to neither ≈øide, but after four hours ≈øpace the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Admiral being ≈ølain, his Gally taken, and about 40 others ≈øunk and fired, victory began to declare her ≈øelf for the Chri≈øtians.

The number of the Turks lo≈øt in this great overthrow, could not be known by rea≈øon of the Multitude that were buryed in the Sea, but <hi>Antonius Gnarnaerius</hi> writing the Hi≈øtory of this war reported 32000 to have peri≈øhed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt them the≈øe of Note, <hi>viz.

               <p>This Peace thus concluded, was proclaimed in <hi>Con≈øtantinople</hi> on the twentieth of <hi>March Anno</hi> 1574, and at <hi>Venice</hi> the thirteenth of <hi>April</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the great amazement of the Confederates, when the better to ju≈øtifie them≈øelves in what they had done, the <hi>Venetian</hi> Senators ≈øent for the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Amba≈ø≈øador and Popes Nuncio, into the Senate hou≈øe, to whom the Duke in a Grave Speech, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre≈ø≈øed him≈øelf to this purpo≈øe.

               <p>One thing is worthy of note, a little before this Tumult happened, <hi>O≈øman</hi> dreamed that he rid a Camel, and being mounted he could not force him to go by fair means nor ≈øtripes, and that then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcending in a rage to revenge it with his ≈øword, the body of the bea≈øt vani≈øhed, leaving in his hand on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the head and bridle, at which dream being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly troubled, he the next day ≈øends for one of his Wizards to interpret it, but he refu≈øed, per≈øwading him to apply him≈øelf to the <hi>Mufty,</hi> which he did, and had this Interpretation, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Camel ≈øignified his Empire, his Riding his abu≈øe in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his de≈øcen≈øion or alighting, his depo≈øing, the vani≈øhing of the body of the Bea≈øt, the revolt of his Subjects, the head and bridle remaining in his hand on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a bare Title, and that he ≈øhould ≈øhortly dye and lo≈øe his Empire, the empty name only of Emperor accompanying him to his grave.

               <p>During the con≈øternation of the <hi>A≈øian Turks,</hi> at the death of their Emperor, putting them in fear the Empire would be di≈ø≈øolved, the <hi>Per≈øian</hi> King was not idle, but with a powerful Army recovered mo≈øt places taken from him, by the Turki≈øh <hi>Sultans,</hi> and the like might have been effected by the Chri≈øtians, had they not been at di≈øcord among≈øt them≈øelves, ≈øo that, that much dreaded Empire, would have been reduced into a ≈ømall circumference, which many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards though too late repented.</p>
               <p>The new <hi>Sultan</hi> altogether governed by his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Officer not yet ≈øuppo≈øing him≈øelf fa≈øt in the Throne, con≈øented to the making away the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>O≈øman,</hi> and children to <hi>Achmat</hi> the late Emperor, in order to Execute which bloody pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, the <hi>Capi-Aga</hi> or <hi>Major Domo</hi> of the Seraglio, went to their Lodgings, with a purpo≈øe to ≈øtrangle

               <p>After which, the new Vizier prote≈øting either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the affairs of the Empire, or fall a Sacrifice, did a little re≈øtore the face of Ju≈øtice, by making exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ≈øome, and terrifying others with threats, in≈øomuch that he was looked upon as a man fit for tho≈øe boi≈øterous times, nor was that his only aim, but he re≈øolved when once ≈øettled in his place, to remove <hi>Mu≈øtapha,</hi> and place <hi>Morat</hi> brother to <hi>O≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in the Imperial ≈øeat, not thinking him≈øelf ≈øafe, under a man that was altogether governed by an imperious woman, de≈øirous of Rule, and was no further capable of the pa≈ø≈øions of love and hate then they were infu≈øed into him.</p>
               <p>During the≈øe troubles of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57574:239"/>Duke <hi>Sbaraskie</hi> lay upon the Frontiers, and would not advance to ratifie the peace between the King his ma≈øter and the new <hi>Sultan,</hi> till ≈øuch time as Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Rowe</hi> his Maje≈øty of Great <hi>Brittains</hi> Amba≈ø≈øador, then re≈øident at the Port had given him his faith for his ≈øecurity, which done, the Duke advanced, and upon his arrival at the Port, was magnificently entertained by the new Vizier, yet e'r any thing was ab≈øolutely concluded, a matter happened which had like to have turned all into nothing; for on the 17 of <hi>June</hi> 1622 Prince <hi>Coreskie,</hi> who had been taken in the late war between <hi>O≈øman</hi> and <hi>Sigi≈ømund</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> was ≈øtrangled in pri≈øon at <hi>Con≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> which put all into murmur and deep con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, to what intent it was done, when ≈øo great a ran≈øom might have been had for his relea≈øe, but mo≈øt believed it was done out of a Politick end, for that the Prince being a mortal enemy to the Turks, if he ≈øhould have been ≈øet at liberty, his re≈øtle≈øs nature would not have ≈øuffered the peace to have continued long inviolable, yet the urgent affairs of <hi>Poland</hi> ≈øo requiring, the Peace was concluded in nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Articles, much to the advantage of the <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> King, the Turks greatly fearing at that jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, the Chri≈øtians uniting again≈øt them, might di≈ømember their Empire.</p>
               <p>The new Vizier by this time having won the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Souldiers, re≈øolved upon his former purpo≈øe of Depo≈øing <hi>Mu≈øtapba,</hi> and ≈øetting up <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> Brother to <hi>O≈øman,</hi> then a child, and the better to forward his purpo≈øe, he cau≈øed the <hi>Aga</hi> of the Janizaries, and ≈øeveral Officers of the Court to be ≈øeized, as contrivers of the death of <hi>Coreskie,</hi> whom him≈øelf had commanded to be ≈øtrangled, which rai≈øed another Tumult; for the Janizaries running furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly to the Court, demanded their Captain, whom
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57574:239"/>the <hi>Ba≈ø≈øa</hi> had ordered to be put to death, and had done great mi≈øchief had he not been delivered, nor were they ≈øo contented, but peremptorily demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the head of the Vi≈øier, ≈øolemnly prote≈øting to facrifice him for the affront done to their order; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which e≈øcaping through the Emperors Garden, he took boat and pa≈ø≈øed over into <hi>A≈øia,</hi> whereupon they ≈øacked his hou≈øe, and found therein great ≈øtore of Trea≈øure, they likewi≈øe demanded the heads of ≈øeveral others, but in the end all was hu≈øhed, yet they proceeded to the Election of a new Vi≈øier, making choice of one <hi>Mu≈øtapha,</hi> a man of a ≈øoft nature and ea≈øily ruled, who ≈øcarcely dur≈øt do Ju≈øtice for fear of offending any man, which proceeding of the in≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Janizaries neverthele≈øs, cau≈øed the wi≈øer ≈øort of men to retire from office and imployment, and to the in≈øufficient daily change and ruine; for the Emperor dur≈øt not move but by the directions of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who≈øe creature he was, ≈øo many in≈øolencies were frequently committed, and all <hi>A≈øia</hi> greatly endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered to be lo≈øt, for at <hi>Bagdat</hi> antiently <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Captain of the Janizaries killed the Ba≈ø≈øa, burnt the <hi>Mufti,</hi> and gave his daughter in Marriage to one <hi>A≈ø≈øan Beg,</hi> pretender to an Antient Inheritance of a bordering Province, to cantonize that part nor <hi>A≈øia</hi> only ≈øtood in ≈øu≈øpence what to do, but the Dominions of the Turki≈øh <hi>Sultan</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> greatly wavered, as doubting whom to obey.</p>
               <p>On the 22 of <hi>Augu≈øt,</hi> an Extraordinary Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor from <hi>Bethlehem Gabor</hi> Prince of <hi>Tran≈øylvania</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Port, who among≈øt other in≈øtructions had order to excu≈øe his ma≈øter, and to declare the rea≈øons, why he had made peace with the Emperor, without the knowledge of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> which were, that the war had continued three years in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Hungary</hi> and had ≈øo wa≈øted the Country, that
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57574:240"/>it was impo≈ø≈øible for him to ≈øtay longer in the field unle≈øs he would have expo≈øed his Army to tho≈øe wants, that would have reduced him to have accepted of an inglorious peace, or to have ≈øuffered a great part of his Souldiers to peri≈øh for want, and that if he had ≈øtood out upon the peace concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sultan and the <hi>Polonian,</hi> the whole ≈øtre≈øs of War would have re≈øted on him and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he de≈øired to be excu≈øed, adding that he meant not long to con≈øerve the peace, therefore de≈øired that he and the Ba≈ø≈øa of <hi>Buda</hi> might have it in joynt Commi≈ø≈øion to rai≈øe ≈øuch Forces as they thought convenient to invade the Empire, when opportunity offered, but this reque≈øt not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the intere≈øt of the Sultan it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
               <p>About this time the <hi>Janizaries</hi> in a tumultuary way came to the Court and demanded all the Offices of gain, and to be Stewards of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Churches which are great as likewi≈øe to take the Farms of Cu≈øtoms wherein they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many outrages, the Vi≈øiers not daring to deny them any thing they demanded. They drunk Wine in the ≈øtreets without prohibition contrary to their Law, and exacted money of the Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to purcha≈øe it, and if denyed took it by force, and murthered without being puni≈øhed, and when at any time complaint was made the Magi≈øtrates an≈øwered they dur≈øt not meddle with them, that had murthered their King, and the Ba≈ø≈øa's them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves de≈øired the complainants patience, telling them that they would bear a part with the general ≈øufferance.</p>
               <p>About the ≈øame time the <hi>Janizaries</hi> in the Gallies which rid before <hi>Smirna</hi> commanded by <hi>Halil</hi> Ba≈ø≈øa,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57574:240"/>a≈ølaulted again≈øt his will the hou≈øes of the Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Con≈øuls, in≈øomuch that the Engli≈øh Con≈øul with all tho≈øe of that Nation, were forced to run naked from their Lodgings, and ≈øave their lives by ≈øwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Admirals Gally, upon which the ma≈øter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs Turks ran≈øacked the lower part of the hou≈øe there, making ≈øpoil to the value of Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand Dollars. The French ≈øu≈øtained more lo≈øs, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> at lea≈øt ten Thou≈øand Dollars, the Con≈øul having likewi≈øe one of his men cut in pieces, nor could the Admiral either by threats or intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties re≈øtrain the≈øe outrages, but was forced for the prevention of further mi≈øchief to put to Sea.</p>
               <p>In <hi>A≈øia</hi> there were three Rebellions, one at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> another at <hi>Arzirum</hi> upon the borders of <hi>Per≈øia,</hi> and a third at <hi>Me≈øopotamia,</hi> which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ruine of all <hi>A≈øia;</hi> yet to prevent the wor≈øt ≈øeveral new officers were made, and an Army rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed in <hi>Grecia,</hi> in order to pa≈øs the <hi>Helle≈øpont,</hi> but in the end nothing was done more then a≈ø≈øembling to little purpo≈øe, all the Turki≈øh Forces on <hi>Europe</hi> ≈øide, which ≈øo impoveri≈øhed the Trea≈øury that the like had not formerly been known, nor were any Exactions and Extortions omitted to rai≈øe mony for defraying the nece≈ø≈øary charges.</p>
               <p>About this time came to the Court of <hi>Poland,</hi> an Amba≈ø≈øador from the great Duke of <hi>Mu≈øcovy</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat a peace, which was hardly granted by rea≈øon ≈øeveral Letters of the ≈øaid Amba≈ø≈øadors being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, plainly demon≈øtrated that at his fir≈øt ≈øetting out his de≈øigns were otherwi≈øe, upon notice that a Peace was concluded with the Sultan, he feigning him≈øelf ≈øick upon the Frontiers, had ≈øent for new in≈øtructions.</p>

But that availed not, for ≈øoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was taken thence and carryed to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon where he had murthered young <hi>O≈øman</hi> and there ≈øtrangled, now the better to plea≈øe the <hi>Polonians</hi> and ob≈øtruct the cau≈øe of War for the future, the Amba≈ø≈øador was not only di≈øpatched with ≈øeveral Noblemen of <hi>Poland,</hi> who had ≈øince the late War remained Pri≈øoners, but it was likewi≈øe concluded that <hi>Jehan Begh,</hi> the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Prince, Author of the War ≈øhould be depo≈øed, and <hi>Michmet Geheray</hi> his Co≈øen, and fir≈øt of the Blood, late Pri≈øoner at the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> ≈øhould ≈øucceed him in that large King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A≈øia</hi> was ≈øtill in doubt to be lo≈øt for that <hi>Aba≈ø≈øa</hi> Ba≈ø≈øa Governour of <hi>Arzirum,</hi> with an Army of one hundred thou≈øand Hor≈øe and Foot had ≈øiezed upon mo≈øt of the Provinces, though without doing any harm to the inhabitants, but where≈øoever he found any of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> he ≈øacrificed them to the Gho≈øt of the dead Emperour, he as he ≈øaid being by God appointed the revenger of his Death, and for that cau≈øe he had taken up arms declaring that he would come to the Port and demand Ju≈øtice upon the Murtherers, and that if he was found a Traytor or

               <p>IN this di≈øtraction of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, the better to calm the tempe≈øt ere it turned all into confu≈øion by Shipwracking the State, the Grand <hi>Vi≈øier</hi> going with the <hi>Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Spahi</hi> to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> demanded to ≈øpeak with <hi>Mu≈øtapha,</hi> and that he would an≈øwer them a few que≈øtions, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ways able to do, and refu≈øing to appear they entered the Palace, and took thence <hi>Morat</hi> or <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> Brother to <hi>O≈øman,</hi> and Son to <hi>Achmat</hi> then about 14 years of Age, and carrying him through the ≈øtreets in triumph, cau≈øed him every where to be proclaimed Emperour to the great content of the <hi>Con≈øtantinopolitans,</hi> who by this mutation hope for peaceful times, and the face of Ju≈øtice re≈øtored which for many months had abandoned the City, every man doing in a manner what he plea≈øed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>MOrat</hi> being dead as is before recited, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> the onely Male ≈øurviver of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Race, was taken from the Pri≈øon in which his Brother had confined him and proclaimed Emperor, though <hi>Morat</hi> in his Life time had by his will bequeathed his Empire to the <hi>Tartar.</hi> This new Emperor being of a ≈øoft nature ≈øuffered him≈øelf to be wholly governed by his Mother, and ≈øuch Mini≈øters as were about him, him≈øelf being altogether weak in his under≈øtanding. So that the War intended again≈øt the <hi>Germans</hi> was by the Council of the great Vi≈øier reverted on the <hi>Co≈ø≈øacks,</hi> yet for ≈øome rea≈øon for a while ≈øu≈øpended, the great Vi≈øier in the mean while ≈øtudying to take ≈øuch out of the way that might Eclip≈øe his grandure, and among≈øt the re≈øt he cau≈øed the Captain Ba≈ø≈øa, the decea≈øed Emperors Chief Favorite to be behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Seli≈øtra,</hi> whither he had ≈øent him Governour for that purpo≈øe.</p>
               <p>The news of Sultan <hi>Ibrahims</hi> advancement to the Throne, being known to the Chri≈øtian Princes, few of them deferred to ≈øend Amba≈ø≈øadors to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate him on that occa≈øion, each making him large Pre≈øents as the manner is, for as 'tis often ≈øaid in this Hi≈øtory none may have Audience of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki≈øh Emperour that comes empty handed.</p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:57574:259"/>
               <p>The Grand Signeour about this time greatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting him≈øelf to the u≈øe of Women, fell into an Apoplexy which put many in doubt of his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and rai≈øed the greater confu≈øion by rea≈øon he had no Children, and that it was given out by his Women with whom he had to do, that he was not capable of generation, therefore the Councellors con≈øulted among≈øt them≈øelves, that in ca≈øe he died without I≈ø≈øue the Son of a Si≈øter or Neece ≈øhould a≈øcend the Throne, and that in no wi≈øe the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øion ≈øhould devolve to the <hi>Tartar,</hi> who≈øe right it is upon the failure of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Male-line, but he ≈øoon after recovering of his indi≈øpo≈øition put them in ≈øome hopes, though that joy was damped by the advice that came to Court of the ruine of ≈øeveral Important Cities on the Frontires of <hi>Per≈øia</hi> by a terrible Earthquake. Yet the Grand Signeour to ≈øhow the World that he intended ≈øomething, gave Order to the Grand Vi≈øier to be≈øiege <hi>A≈øac,</hi> po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed by the <hi>Co≈ø≈øacks</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Morat,</hi> as is afore≈øaid which he did both by Sea and Land, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great lo≈øs of his be≈øt men, reduced it to the Turki≈øh obedience, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1641. at what time it was abandoned by the Garri≈øon of <hi>Co≈ø≈øacks,</hi> who de≈øpairing to hold it long departed with all their ≈øub≈øtance.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Mu≈øcovite</hi> by this time beginning to dread the Tempe≈øt of War that was ready to fall upon him, and not able of him≈øelf to re≈øi≈øt ≈øuch a power as the Grand Seignior had rai≈øed by rea≈øon of inte≈øtine troubles, and de≈øpairing to be aided by the <hi>Polonians,</hi> whom he had ≈øome years before de≈øerted in their greate≈øt nece≈ø≈øity, he thought it the ≈øafe≈øt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a peace, which by Pre≈øents, and many intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he procured to be ratified for the ≈øpace of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years; It being the rather con≈øented to by the Grand Seignior, that he might be at lei≈øure to turn his Armes upon <hi>Hungary,</hi> in which ≈øo many of his Predece≈ø≈øors have been foiled.</p>

               <p>The news of the≈øe proceedings greatly troubled the Emperor, then infe≈øted with the <hi>French</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and had ≈øeized upon <hi>Stra≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> a free City of the Empire, yet like a prudent Prince he u≈øed many per≈øwa≈øions to reduce the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to their former obedience, publi≈øhing his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, wherein he promi≈øed them all convenient li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for the exerci≈øe of their Religion, and that they ≈øhould have a <hi>Palatine,</hi> a native of <hi>Hungary</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering likewi≈øe a general pardon for all that had pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, but this availed not, for <hi>Teckely</hi> aiming at the principality of <hi>Tran≈øilvania</hi> (which he mu≈øt utterly de≈øpair of obtaining if he di≈øplea≈øed the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior) rejected all the≈øe rea≈øonable conce≈ø≈øions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that he would not tru≈øt to promi≈øes which were not likely to indure longer than he had power

               <p>About this time the Grand Seignior fearing the power of the <hi>Mu≈øcovite</hi> ≈øhould refund on part of his Dominions, u≈øed great diligence by his Agents to procure a Reconciliation, the which was the ea≈øier hearkened to by rea≈øon of the differences ari≈øing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the grandees, threatened an inte≈øtine War, whereupon in <hi>May</hi> 1681. a Truce was concluded for the ≈øpace of Twenty years, though contrary to the opinion of the <hi>Polonians,</hi> who by a conjunction with the numerous Forces of that Dukedom, were in hopes to gain more ea≈øie conditions at the Port then in the Articles between them and the Grand Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or were included, in order to which that King had a≈ø≈øembled a <hi>Diet</hi> at <hi>War≈øaw,</hi> which after Sixteen weeks con≈øultation, by rea≈øon of the perver≈øene≈øs of a deputy of <hi>Lythuania,</hi> broke up without re≈øolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on any one point referred to their con≈øideration.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of the year 1682.

               <p>Within the <hi>Seraglio</hi> are kept to the number of five hundred, ≈øuch Youths as are taken up for Tribute-Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in <hi>Graecia,</hi> and other Parts of the Empire; all Sons of Chri≈øtians, who taken young from their Parents, are in≈øtructed and brought up in divers Arts; and taught more e≈øpecially to manage all ≈øorts of Weapons, and to be perfect in the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Super≈øtition; few of them being above eight Years of Age at their fir≈øt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.

               <p>He hath in continual pay a thou≈øand Eunuches, whom the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Hundurni;</hi> many of which are imployed to attend his Virgins and Concubines in the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> They are not only deprived of their Genitors, but in their Youth they have their whole Privities ≈ømoothed off by their Bellies: And in their Turbants they bear a Silver Quill or Crue, through which they evacuate their Urine. This Inhuman Barbarity was fir≈øt commanded by <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent, who grew jealous of them upon his ob≈øerving a Gelding back a Mare; gathering from thence, that his Eunuches though they had lo≈øt their Genitor, might yet dalliance with his Females.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Seraglio</hi> of Women is within the Palace, in which are con≈øtantly five hundred Virgins, the choice≈øt Beauties that can be procured, being all Daughters to Chri≈øtians, taken from their Parents when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight Years of Age or under; none above are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, le≈øt they ≈øhould be debauched e're they enter. The≈øe are brought up to curious Works: And when at any time the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> is de≈øirous to have any of them brought to his Bed, he the Day before gives notice to the Captain of the Eunuches; who commands tho≈øe under him to put them in order, and array them in their be≈øt Attire. Which done the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> attended by the ≈øaid Captain, walking between them as they ≈øtand demurely in rowes on either Hand; and where he likes, drops his Handkerchief, of which he has many hanging at his Girdle; which the Eunuches that follow, ob≈øerving, put her (or as many as his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:57574:322"/>is to ≈øignifie by ≈øuch Tokens) into a Coach, and carry them to his Lodgings; where they are gorgeou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attired, and u≈øed as he has occa≈øion for them: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they return, not to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of the Virgins, but have other Lodgings appointed them. And when by rea≈øon of the Failure of Tribute-Virgins, the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio</hi> grows empty, they purcha≈øe the Faire≈øt they can find in the Market of <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> whither they are brought to be ≈øold as Slaves.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>Seraglio</hi> there is, in which the <hi>Grand Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> keeps his <hi>Sultana's</hi> or <hi>Sultane≈ø≈øes,</hi> and their Children; as likewi≈øe, ≈øuch other Concubines, of whom for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light he hath cho≈øen from among≈øt the Virgins. He never marries; but when any one is brought to his Bed ≈øide, he gives her a Golden Head-tire, and ten thou≈øand <hi>A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;</hi> cau≈øing her to live apart, daily increa≈øing her Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. The fir≈øt that bears him a Child, is called the <hi>Sultana</hi> or <hi>Sultane≈øs,</hi> and is accounted Mi≈øtre≈øs of the re≈øt of his Women; and by him, for the mo≈øt part, be≈øt beloved. The re≈øt that hath been brought to his Bed, and with whom he hath dallianced, are returned back to their ≈øeveral Apartments, there to expect the I≈ø≈øue; and if they prove not with Child, then are they given in Marriage to his Slaves; whom for their ≈øakes he advances to great Dignity, for the mo≈øt part.</p>
               <p>He hath three hundred <hi>Sollacchi,</hi> who march conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually about his Per≈øon, and make (as it were) his Guard, being under the Command of the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries;</hi> all of them attired in Linnen-Garments hanging down beneath their Knees; and over them quilted Wa≈øt-Coats, with half Sleeves of Taffety, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask, or Sattin; and on their Heads Caps and Feathers, carrying Bows and Arrows.

               <p>Another ≈øort of Hor≈øemen there are, called <hi>Caripices,</hi> not exceeding eight hundred; who ≈øtill ride near the Grand Seignior, as his Life-guard, in the middle of the Battalion of the <hi>Janizaries;</hi> and are the be≈øt Hor≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men accounted of all others, being (for the mo≈øt part) Sons of the Great Commanders.</p>
               <p>As for his Foot Forces, the chief Strength con≈øi≈øts of <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who are Children taken from their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Parents, and inured in their Youth to all manner of Hard≈øhip, taught all the U≈øe of Arms, and trained up in all Warlike Di≈øcipline, till they are adjudged fit to be inrolled for the War.

There remains twenty four thou≈øand of them in <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> and a far greater number in divers Places of the Empire. They are commanded by their <hi>Aga,</hi> or Captain, to whom nothing is ≈øo fatal as their Love for him; for then the Grand Seignior has him in mi≈øtru≈øt, and well is it if he be not made away. They ≈øleep together in great Halls, their Beds being placed on either ≈øide; and all tho≈øe of a Squadron feed at one Table; the Younger ever ≈øerve the Elder: And if any one of them be ab≈øent from his Lodging in the Night, unle≈øs upon publick occa≈øion, then is he the next day ≈øeverely c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They likewi≈øe arre≈øt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, and ≈øee good Order kept, being feared of all Men; in≈øomuch that if they buy any thing, they will have it at their own Price, the Vender not daring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øe it. They have great Power in their Princes Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; no Emperour thinking him≈øelf ≈øafe in his Throne, till they approve of him: So that to gain their good Opinion, every new Emperour at his entring upon the Government, di≈øtributes large Sums of Money among≈øt them, and increa≈øes their Stipends.</p>
               <p>Though the chief Strength of the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Foot For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces re≈øts in the <hi>Janizaries;</hi> yet are there another ≈øort
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:57574:325"/>of Foot-Men, called <hi>Acouices;</hi> which is a Forlorn Hope. The≈øe receive no Pay, but have free liberty to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; ≈øo that they deliver the fifth Part to the Grand Seigniour. Another kind there are, called <hi>A≈øapi;</hi> who are but of ≈ømall Account, and rather u≈øed as <hi>Pioneers,</hi> than to encounter the Enemy; yet are they often thru≈øt into the Front of the Battle, with their Bodies to blunt the Enemies Swords, or to ≈øcale the Walls of Towns; that by being ≈ølaughter'd, their Dead Bodies may fill up the Ditches, and ≈øo give the <hi>Janizaries</hi> opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on their Dead Carka≈ø≈øes to mount the Bullwarks.</p>
               <p>The Grand Seignior keeps in continual Pay ≈øix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand Gunners, whom the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Topegi;</hi> and for the Guard of the Powder and Shot, upon the March of the Army, twelve thou≈øand Men are kept in pay, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Jebegi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Grand Seignior hath likewi≈øe certain Officers at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on him, to the number of three thou≈øand, whom they call <hi>Chiaus;</hi> which act in the Nature of Serjeants at Arms. The≈øe Men are well e≈øteemed, and are often employed in Emba≈ø≈øies to Forreign Princes: They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo carry Letters or Commendations from the Grand Seignior, or his Chief Vizier; and are impower'd to apprehend Malefactors: But never go to the Wars, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs the Grand Seignior be there in Per≈øon. They are commanded by a <hi>Chiaus Ba≈ø≈øa;</hi> who is of ≈øuch Credit with all Men, that when he is ≈øent by the Grand Seignior to any <hi>Ba≈ø≈øa, Sanzack,</hi> or <hi>Caddi,</hi> to have any Man's Head cut off, though he have no Warrant in writing, yet his Authority is not di≈øputed.</p>
               <p>Thus have I ≈øet down the Land Forces of the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Empire; in number ≈øo great, that in ≈øhew they ≈øhould breed Confu≈øion, and ruin them≈øelves; yet ≈øuch is the Order and Di≈øcipline, that in that point they give place to none. They live (for the mo≈øt part) on a little Bread
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:57574:325"/>baked in the A≈øhes, with Rice and Powder of Fle≈øh dried in the Sun. Wine is forbidden them by their Law, though 'tis often drunk by them in private, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecially the Great Commanders. No Women are ≈øeen in their Armies. In their March they ob≈øerve a wonderful Silence; and all the Soldiers are governed by the Beck of the Hand, or Shew of the Countenance. Quarrels and Thefts are ≈øeverely puni≈øhed. When they March they dare not enter any Corn-field or Vineyard. The Valiant are a≈ø≈øured of Preferment, and the Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of Puni≈øhment.</p>
               <p>As for the Grand Seignior's Naval Forces, they are great; he having of late, for Gain-≈øake, allured many Chri≈øtian Carpenters and Shipwrights to his Ar≈øenal, and hath a great number of Men trained up in Marine Affairs, by being continually imployed aboard his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies at <hi>Rhodes, Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Mitylene</hi> and <hi>Alexandria.</hi> He has al≈øo at his Beck the Pirates of <hi>Tunis, Tripoley, Sally, Argire,</hi> and other Places; from among≈øt whom he choo≈øes his prime Commanders in Marine Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
               <p>To maintain the≈øe great Forces, it is requi≈øite a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Ma≈øs of Money ≈øhould be imployed, which is the Sinews of War, and without which ≈øo great an Empire could not be kept in frame, though many are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Grand Seignior's Annual Revenues exceed not eight Millions; meaning thereby, that which is collected of his Subjects, and upon the account of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtoms: For which they give the≈øe Rea≈øons: <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> That the <hi>Turks</hi> have no care but of Arms; the which do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ruin, than enrich a Country. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume ≈øo many Men in their Enterprizes, that they ≈øcarce leave a ≈øufficient number to manure the Land; in≈øomuch that the Subjects de≈øpairing to injoy their Wealth, and nece≈ø≈øary Commodities, which they might get by their Labour and Indu≈øtry, employ not them≈øelves to work
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:57574:326"/>nor traffick, more than by nece≈ø≈øity they are con≈øtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For they argue, 'tis to no purpo≈øe to labour for another, their Lives and E≈øtates being daily expo≈øed to the Mercy of their Prince: And for this Rea≈øon, many ≈øpacious Countries in the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Empire lie wa≈øte; which neglect frequently cau≈øes a Dearth. A <hi>Third</hi> Rea≈øon that is given, why the Grand Seignior's Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues are no greater, is, for that when he Conquers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Country, he a≈ø≈øigns the Lands therein to his <hi>Tima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,</hi> who ≈øerve in the Wars, and are no otherwi≈øe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to accommodate their Prince.</p>
               <p>But although his ordinary Revenues amount to no great Sum, in con≈øideration of the large Circuit of his Empire; yet his extraordinary Profits accruing by Confi≈øcations, Pre≈øents, (for no Stranger may approach his Pre≈øence empty handed) and Mony rai≈øed upon Places and Offices of Tru≈øt, amount to a far greater Sum than what has been mentioned. Nor are the Sums ≈ømall, which he draws from the Princes their Tributaries, that are not ab≈øolutely under his Juri≈ødiction; as <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davia, Vallachia,</hi> and <hi>Tran≈øylvania,</hi> with many more. So that in all, moderate Writers affirm, That his Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers are yearly ≈øupplied with twenty Millions: The Management of which is left to the <hi>Defterdari,</hi> or chief Trea≈øurer, who has many Sub-officers under him.</p>
               <p>Thus much having been ≈øpoken of the Forces, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, and great Officers; I ≈øhall now proceed to give the <hi>Reader</hi> a View of their Religion, if it may without offence be ≈øo termed; which they call the Law of their great Prophet.</p>
               <p>As for their Religion, it began in the time of <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clius</hi> the Emperor; at what time the Here≈øie of <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Ne≈øtorius</hi> ≈øpread it ≈øelf: to who≈øe Infamous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelytes <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Impo≈øtor, born in <hi>Arabia,</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him≈øelf; impiou≈øly denying the Divinity of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> and proclaiming him≈øelf a Prophet ≈øent from <hi>God,</hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:57574:326"/>a Multitude after him: In≈øomuch that ≈øuch as would not receive his impious Tenents by fair means, he compelled by force: And the better to ingratiate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf with the lewd and licentious ≈øort of People, he to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated all manner of Lu≈øt, and Worldly Delights. By the Law this Impo≈øtor left, and that now has over≈øpread two Parts of the World, a Di≈øtinction is made between clean and unclean Meats, to content the <hi>Jews,</hi> who are the greate≈øt Merchants in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire. They al≈øo maintain Circumci≈øion, but not at the Expiration of Eight Days, according to the <hi>Jewi≈øh</hi> Cu≈øtom; but at the End of Eight Years, when the Infant is able to make a Confe≈ø≈øion of his Belief; and lifting up his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ≈øpeak the≈øe words in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue, <hi>viz. There is but One God, and Mahomet is his Prophet; one God, and equal Prophets.</hi> The Circumci≈øion ended, they fea≈øt three Days. As for the Female Children, they at eight Years old ≈øpeak the ≈øame words; but are not capable of Circumci≈øion. If any Chri≈øtian turn A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtate, and deny his Redeemer, which (to the lo≈øs of their Souls) too many do, only to avoid Taxations and Tribute, they are led through the Town or City, where they dwell in great Triumph, many People pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenting them with Gifts, as they pa≈øs, to encourage them to per≈øevere in what they have undertaken. And for the Men, at what Age ≈øoever they are, they mu≈øt be Circumci≈øed.</p>
               <p>The Law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> is contained in his <hi>Alchoran;</hi> wherein he confe≈ø≈øeth <hi>One God, and honoureth Je≈øus Chri≈øt as a great Prophet:</hi> But impiou≈øly denies him to be the Son of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> by their Law are forbid to wor≈øhip Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or to have any placed in their <hi>Mo≈øques:</hi> The whole Series of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> being full of Fables and Fictions, much like to tho≈øe the Poets feigned of the <hi>Elizium</hi>-Shades; indulging Men in all Sen≈øuality during this
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:57574:327"/>Life, and promi≈øing them a <hi>Paradi≈øe,</hi> where they ≈øhall enjoy the like more perfectly after Death.</p>
               <p>Their Sabbath is kept on our <hi>Fryday.</hi> They keep Lent thirty Days; during which ≈øpace they eat nothing in the day-time, but take their Repa≈øt after Sun-≈øet, ab≈øtaining from Wine and Women. This Lent is called by them <hi>Ramaden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They likewi≈øe ob≈øerve an <hi>Ea≈øter,</hi> called <hi>Bayran;</hi> which continues for the ≈øpace of the three Days, though not always prefixed by rea≈øon they begin it in the New of the Moon.</p>
               <p>They have no Bells in their <hi>Mo≈øques;</hi> neither do they ≈øuffer the Chri≈øtians to have any that live among≈øt them. When they enter the ≈øaid <hi>Mo≈øques,</hi> they leave their Shooes at the Door, and take them again when they return. Where ≈øoever they ≈øit or ≈øtand in their Religious Hou≈øes, they have Tape≈øtry or Mats under them, as not thinking their Feet holy enough to ≈øtand in that Place, during the Reading their Law; and if they look back, or ≈øcratch their Head till the Orizon is ended, they think they have lo≈øt the Benefit they were at that time to receive by their coming thither. They are not much addicted to Learning; yet of late they have brought up their Children to u≈øe the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue, in which their Law is written.</p>
               <p>By this Law they have leave to marry as many Wives as they can maintain; and when once any of them proves with Child, her Husband may not carnally know her till ≈øhe is delivered. They have certain Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages contracted during Plea≈øure, which they call <hi>Kebin,</hi> mo≈øtly practi≈øed by Strangers; who may, for a certain Sum of Money, have the U≈øe of a Woman during his Plea≈øure: Yet when he turns her off, if ≈øhe have any Children, he is bound to keep them. A <hi>Turk</hi> having had to do with a <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> Woman, both of them upon Conviction are to ≈øuffer Death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:57574:327"/>≈øhe add ≈øin to ≈øin, by renouncing her Faith. The like is to be ob≈øerved between a <hi>Chri≈øtian,</hi> and a <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki≈øh</hi> VVoman; though either Offence, by bribing the <hi>Caddi's</hi> or Judges, may be omitted.</p>
               <p>They allow of Divorce in ca≈øe of Barrenne≈øs or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency.</p>
               <p>The chief Interpreter of the≈øe Laws, is the <hi>Muphti,</hi> or <hi>Arch-Prie≈øt,</hi> who is cho≈øen by the Grand Seignior; and is greatly reverenced among≈øt the <hi>Turks,</hi> being Head of their Church, and Decider of all Controver≈øies ari≈øing in matter of their Super≈øtitious Religion. His Eminency is ≈øuch, that all the <hi>Ba≈ø≈øa's</hi> are ≈øubject to his Direction. He aba≈øeth him≈øelf not ≈øo much as to ≈øit in the <hi>Divano;</hi> only pa≈ø≈øing through it, when he is ≈øent for by the Grand Seignior; who at his approach ri≈øeth from his Seat, (an Honour not allowed to any other) and then they ≈øit together, and familiarly di≈øcour≈øe of their Affairs.</p>
               <p>The next to him are the <hi>Cadile≈øquires,</hi> or <hi>Tali≈ømen:</hi> Two Doctors of the Law, who≈øe place it is to Examine the <hi>Caddi's</hi> or Judges, who are di≈øper≈øed throughout the Provinces of the Empire, and are always attendant upon the Grand Seignior: The one of them having Juri≈ødiction over all the <hi>European Caddi's,</hi> and the other on tho≈øe re≈øiding in <hi>A≈øia;</hi> there being few Cities, or great Towns, in which one of the <hi>Caddi's</hi> have not their Re≈øidence there, to hear and determine Matters of Controver≈øie ari≈øing between Man and Man. The <hi>Cadile≈øquires</hi> are likewi≈øe Soveraign Judges within their own Juri≈ødiction, in all Cau≈øes belonging to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as it were Patriarks. They are of great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and have places in the <hi>Divano,</hi> and in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil with the <hi>Ba≈ø≈øa's,</hi> con≈øult the weighty Affairs of the Empire.</p>
               <p>There is a third Degree of Church-Men, not belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Law, called <hi>Mulli;</hi> which they account
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:57574:328"/>their Bi≈øhops, and are directed in their Affairs by the <hi>Muphti.</hi> Their Office is to place and di≈øplace Church-Men as they ≈øee it convenient.</p>
               <p>Another ≈øort there are, called the <hi>Nuderi≈øi,</hi> who act in the nature of Suffragans, and have under them ≈øeveral young Doctors of the Law, who are their Di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, called <hi>Naipi;</hi> who are, in the Ab≈øence of the <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di's,</hi> con≈øtituted to hear and redre≈øs Grievances.</p>
               <p>After the≈øe are the <hi>Hagi,</hi> who are employed to write their Books, they in no wi≈øe allowing them to be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and inferior unto the≈øe are the <hi>Ca≈ø≈øi,</hi> who read un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them what they write, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The≈øe are their ≈øeveral Degrees of Lawyers, and Church-Men; for the <hi>Turks</hi> are governed by a kind of Eccle≈øia≈øtical Law, according to their <hi>Alchoran.</hi> Many Colledges they have, which they call <hi>Medre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øae's,</hi> ≈øituate not only in <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> but in divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cities.</p>
               <p>And thus, <hi>Reader,</hi> have I related the Suceinct Series of <hi>This History,</hi> as near as can be gathered from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of undoubted Credit, and my own Knowledge: And now nothing more remains, but to make known the Va≈øtne≈øs of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire; which is, for the mo≈øt part, the Subject of <hi>This Hi≈øtory.</hi>

            <p>This ≈øecond overthrow greatly di≈øcouraged the Vi≈øier, who was advancing to joyne this body, but upon the news of the defeat he in great perplexity retired to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> there to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect new ≈øupplyes, whil≈øt the King and Duke
