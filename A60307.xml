            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Their Riſe and aſpiring to Greatneſs, was after this manner; <hi>Mahomet</hi> the perſian Sultan wreſting the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57574:30"/>from the <hi>Caliph</hi> or Succeſſor of <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Impoſtor, or as they falſly called him, their Great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, whoſe Erroneous Doctrine had infected all <hi>Aſia, Affrick,</hi> and part of <hi>Europe,</hi> to provide againſt the worſt ſtrengthned himſelf, and the better to do it, ſent to the Turkiſh Chief in <hi>Armenia</hi> to furniſh him with a competent number of Men of War, who in compliance to the Sultans Command cauſed 3000 to March under the Leading of one of his chief Captains named <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grolipix,</hi> by the help of which he overthrew the Caliph of <hi>Babylon,</hi> with an incredible Slaughter of his Army; and being further minded to make an Expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Indians</hi> that bordered his Country, and knowing by Experience the great courage of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and their ſingular dexterity in Archery, he reſolved to retain them for his further Service; ſo that when they deſired to be conducted over the River <hi>Araxis,</hi> he not only refuſed to permit it, but alſo threatned them, if they offered to make any further mention of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, which Indignity cauſed them to take the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of withdrawing themſelves into the Deſart of <hi>Caranonitis,</hi> and there like Out-laws to live upon Spoil; the News of which no ſooner reached the Sultan's ear, but he commanded ten of his Captains to March againſt <hi>Tangrolipix</hi> with an Army of 20000 choice Soldiers compoſed of divers Nations, which Incamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the border of a Forreſt, wherein the Turkiſh Captain reſided with his Forces, they were in the dead of the night ſet upon and put to flight with great Slaughter; ſo that the Turks furniſhing themſelves with the Spoyls of the ſlain appeared more boldly in the Field, and were in a ſhort time increaſed to 50000 fighting men by ſuch Outlaws and other Villains, as upon the bruit of their Succeſs reſorted to 'um, which cauſed <hi>Mahomet,</hi> now jealous of his other Subjects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt to raiſe a great Army and to advance againſt <hi>Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In fine, both Armies met on the great Plain before the City <hi>Iſpahan</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and began a dreadful Battle, which with great Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter laſted till Sultan <hi>Mahomet</hi> fell from his Horſe, and broak his neck, at what time both Armies ceaſed from fight, and by unanimous conſent choſe <hi>Tangrolipix</hi> Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the Dominions appertaining to that large Kingdom, who was no ſooner ſeated in his Throne, but he cauſed the Garriſons that kept the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage over <hi>Araxis</hi> to be removed, and called in the Turks his Country-men then dwelling on the other ſide, and by degrees advanced them to all the chief Places of Truſt, depoſing the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Sarazens,</hi> the Ancient Inhabitants of thoſe Dominions; but long he had not wielded his Scepter e'r he made War upon <hi>Piſaſiris</hi> the <hi>Caliph</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and after ſundry Battles having ſlain him annexed his Kingdom to <hi>Perſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Succeſs firing him with a deſire to extend his Dominions wider, he ſent <hi>Cutlu-Muſes</hi> his Nephew to war on the <hi>Arabians,</hi> but thoſe People as dexterous in Archery as the <hi>Turks</hi> ſoon overthrew him with the ſlaughter of a great part of his Army, and therefore in his Return requeſted of <hi>Stephen</hi> the Greek Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Lievtenant in <hi>Media,</hi> that he might paſs through thoſe Territories into his own Country; but he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied him paſſage, but oppoſed him with a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Army, which was by the <hi>Turks</hi> defeated, and the Lievtenant taken Priſoner: After which the Sultan in Perſon made an Expedition againſt the <hi>Arabians,</hi> thinking to revenge the late diſgrace, but procured a greater for himſelf, was likewiſe overthrown, which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57574:31"/>cauſed him to bend his Forces to the Conqueſt of <hi>Media,</hi> to effect which he ſent his Brother <hi>Aſan,</hi> but in the mean while his Nephew fearing his diſpleaſure for diſobeying his Command fled, and gathering to him a ſtrong Power, ſeized on <hi>Paſar</hi> a ſtrong City of <hi>Choraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians,</hi> yet the Expedition was not thereby obſtructed; but his Army had ſcarce entred the Confines of <hi>Media</hi> before the Emperor's new Lievtenant gave Battle, and put the <hi>Turks</hi> to flight following the Execution for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miles.</p>
               <p>This defeat inraged the Sultan, and cauſed him to ſend an Army double the number of the former under the Conduct of <hi>Humbramy-Alim</hi> his other Brother, who after ſix days Siege took <hi>Arzen</hi> a Town rich in Merchandize, but the Lievtenant having joyned his Forces with thoſe of <hi>Liperates</hi> Governour of <hi>Iberia,</hi> who came to his Aſſiſtance, the Battle was joyned, which continued bloody and doubtful for the ſpace of four hours, at the end of which the Victory fell to the Chriſtians, who followed the Execution till Night put an end to it, yet <hi>Liperates</hi> fighting valiantly was taken and carried into <hi>Perſia,</hi> for whoſe Ranſom the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſent great Preſents; but the Sultan out of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous bravery ſent him home Ranſom-free, only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing never to bear Arms againſt him more, and with him ſent <hi>Seriph</hi> a Mahumetan Prieſt as his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, to demand of the Emperor that he would become Tributary to the Sultan, and that thereby an Eternal Peace might iſſue, which the Emperor rejected with juſt diſdain. Whereupon the Sultan invaded the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces with great Forces, but underſtanding upon his approaching <hi>Caeſarea</hi> that the Emperor's Army was upon the March, reſolving to give him Battle, and that if he ſhould be overthrown there was little hopes of retreating by reaſon he had left ſo many Enemies at his back, he returned into <hi>Media</hi> and laid Siege to the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57574:32"/>ſtrong City of <hi>Mantizichiert,</hi> furiouſly aſſaulting it for thirty days without intermiſſion; but after the loſs of <hi>Alean</hi> his chief Captain, and 20000 <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> he in great perplexity raiſed the Siege, and upon his return being diſpleaſed with his Brother <hi>Habraim-Alim,</hi> he fled by Night and joyned ſuch Forces as he could raiſe with <hi>Cutlu Muſes,</hi> againſt whom the Sultan marched, and overthrowing them in plain Battle took <hi>Habraim</hi> Priſoner, and immediatly commanded his head to be ſtruck off, when in the mean while <hi>Cutlu Muſes,</hi> and his Couſin <hi>Melech</hi> fled into <hi>Armenia</hi> with the remainder of the broken Army, and from thence ſent Ambaſſadors to the Greek Emperor to take them into protection, but the Sultan following them cloſe with his Army, they removed from thence and fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Arabia,</hi> upon which the Sultan leaving the purſuit, turned his Army upon <hi>Iberia</hi> and waſted the Country with fire and ſword in many places; but upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of <hi>Acoluthus</hi> the Emperor's Lievtenant he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to <hi>Tauris,</hi> leaving behind him one <hi>Sannich</hi> with 3000 <hi>Turks</hi> to infeſt the Imperial Territories. At which time the Emperor <hi>Constantius</hi> died, leaving his Empreſs and three Children, the former being obliged in an Oath not to marry, though afterwards that Oath was diſpenſed with by the Patriarch, and ſhe married to one <hi>Diogines</hi> whom ſhe pardoned as the Sentence of death was about to paſs upon him for conſpiracy to diſmember the Empire: So that he being proclaimed Emperor, advanced with an Army againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> paſting over into <hi>Aſia,</hi> where they were waſting the Provinces with fire and ſword, upon whoſe approach the Sultan doubting the Event, ſent one part of his Army into the South, and the other into the North, the latter ſurpriſing upon its arrival new <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and ſo laded with rich Booties departed, upon notice of which the Emperor purſued them, and after a ſharp Incounter
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57574:32"/>put them to flight, recovering the Booty and Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, at which time the City of <hi>Hierapolis</hi> was ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to him, and many other Cities which the <hi>Turks</hi> had taken; and then dividing his Army, paſt on with one part of it to <hi>Syria,</hi> and left the other part to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the new Conqueſt, which in his abſence was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the <hi>Turks,</hi> upon News of which the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Aleppo</hi> revolted from him. But whilſt the <hi>Turks</hi> ſuppoſed they had him in a Toil, he without any noiſe fell in with their Army and put them to flight, making great ſlaughter of ſuch as fled, and then receiving the Homage of the ſeveral Countries he paſſed through, he came to <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Caelicia,</hi> and there quartered his Army, and ſo returned to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperor having recruited himſelf all Winter, early in the Spring haſted to his Army to oppoſe the <hi>Turks</hi> that were abroad ravaging the Country about new <hi>Caeſaria,</hi> and after having repreſſed them paſſed on to the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> where leaving part of his Army with his Lievtenant for ſecuring the Frontires, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into <hi>Capadocia;</hi> but in his abſence his Lievtenant was routed by the Turkiſh Army which the Emperor underſtanding at <hi>Sabestia,</hi> he ſent the Governour of <hi>Antioch</hi> with part of his Army to oppoſe them at <hi>Mop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiphestia,</hi> but they before were broken by the <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who had took from them the rich Booties they had acquired by the Sacks of many Cities.</p>
               <p>And thus this Emperour continued to defend the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces with great Succeſs againſt the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Forces of a furious Adverſary all the Reign of <hi>Tangrolipix</hi> the firſt Turkiſh Sultan of <hi>Perſia.</hi>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57574:33"/>great Commanders after ſeveral wounds received, yet comforted by the Sultan, and within a while honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably diſmiſs'd, when during the time of his Captivity <hi>John Ducas</hi> his <hi>Caeſar, Pſellus</hi> one of the Senators, and other of the Faction had thruſt the Empreſs into a Monaſtery, and proclaimed <hi>Michael Ducas</hi> her Eldeſt Son Emperor, and when they heard that the Emperor <hi>Diogenes</hi> was at liberty, they ſent out Letters to the Lievtenants of the Provinces to apprehend him which made him gather a great Power, but being diſcomfitted by <hi>Andronicus</hi> the Eldeſt Son of <hi>John Ducas,</hi> he was forced to reſign his Claim to the Empire; nor were his Enemies content with that, but afterward put out his eyes in ſuch ſort that he died miſerably.

Though <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> flying with the remainder of his broken Army, gave out that himſelf had Victory on his ſide, the leſs to diſmay his Subjects; yet ſo far the Terror of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> wrought, that the <hi>Infidels</hi> fled into fenced Cities, leaving the Villages deſolate; whereupon they beſieged <hi>Antioch,</hi> which with little difficulty they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, being joyfully received by the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> there dwelling; next <hi>Iconium</hi> and <hi>Heraclea,</hi> two Cities of note ſurrendred upon Summons. <hi>Solyman</hi> ſtill flying before the Victors, and duly ſending Letters to his Couzen <hi>Axan</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> Sultan for Aid; but he not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſupply him againſt ſuch powerful Opponents, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> recovered all that had been torn from the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire, the which according to their Contract made with the Emperor they reſtored.</p>
               <p>The Princes thus Victorious in <hi>Aſia,</hi> called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, in which it was decreed that an Oath ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred as well to the Princes Commanders as to the

               <p>And now the <hi>Turks</hi> perceiving they were no ways able to oppoſe the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in open fight, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſurpriſe and cut off as many as they might by Ambuſhment, and therefore ſent ſeveral ſtragling Troops to face <hi>Antioch,</hi> upon which the <hi>Flemins</hi> ſallied and followed hard till within the danger of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh, where they had been inevitably loſt, had not the Citizens, who were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> timely come in to their aſſiſtance, and put the <hi>Turks</hi> to flight, and then the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies drawing forth, marched as far as the River <hi>Oron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> before they met with any reſiſtance, but there the <hi>Turks</hi> had fortified the Bridge and Banks on the other ſide, but being overwhelmed with ſhowers of Engliſh Arrows ſent from the Squadron commanded by <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> they ſoon gave ground, and left the Paſſage open, and ſo the Princes paſſing the River, came to the other <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> of which one <hi>Caſſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu</hi> was Governour, to the Relief of which the <hi>Turks</hi> came with an Army of 100000 Horſe and Foot, but were repulſed by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and returned with 20000 leſs than they brought; ſo that the City on the third day of <hi>June,</hi> 1098. was ſecretly and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the knowledge of the Governour delivered by one <hi>Phirrus</hi> to Prince <hi>Bohemund</hi> of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> who furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly entering a diſmal ſlaughter enſued, inſomuch that the Streets run with blood.

               <p>The loſs of <hi>Antioch</hi> being made known to <hi>Corbanus</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> Sultan's Lievetenant, as he lay before <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> he raiſed the Sige, and with all his Forces marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Antioch,</hi> reſolving to put all upon the Hazard of a Battle, againſt whom the Princes drew out their

And thus conquering they paſſed on taking ſeveral Cities of note till they came within the view of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> upon ſight of which they ſhouted ſo loud, that all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try reſounded with the joyful Acclamations, and with their hands and eyes extended towards Heaven, they called upon the name of Jeſus, and many in humility to the place where our Bleſſed Lord had ſo often preached his Goſpel, fell to the Ground and kiſſed it with great Affection, making freſh Vows never to leave the City till they had delivered it from the <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels;</hi> but their ſtrength was much impaired by reaſon of a Peſtilence that had the Autumn before hapned in the Army; yet in a Council of the Princes and chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, it was reſolved that the Siege ſhould immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately be begun, and carried on with all the vigour ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
               <p>The Governour having notice of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and what was intended, delayed not to prepare all things that might conduce to the making a ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous defence, having a little before received a ſtrong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit of able Soldiers, and a ſupply of all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; yet the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> after having got what knowledge they could of the ſtate of Affairs within the City, ſat down before it on the North, for towards the Eaſt and the Weſt the broken Rocks and ſhattered Hills render it very incommodious.

               <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> having refreſhed themſelves, it was concluded amongſt the Princes, that the fifth day the Aſſault ſhould be given, which accordingly was done with ſuch bravery, that the <hi>Turks</hi> were beaten from their Defences and miſerably ſlaughtered by the ſhot of the Archers; but they wanting ſcaling Ladders, and the weather being exceeding hot, the retreat was ſounded, but being deſirous of nothing more than winning the City, five days after they gave it another fierce Aſſault, which made the Walls to tremble, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that Policy or Valour could afford being wanting on the part of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but ſcarcity of Water afflicting them with drought, and the exceſſive heat of the Weather fruſtrated this ſecond Attempt; for the Enemy had either ſtopped up or poyſoned all the Wells about the City, unleſs that of <hi>Siloe,</hi> whoſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had worked out the Poiſon, and was become whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but that yielded not half enough to ſuffice the Army.</p>

               <p>Thus was the Famous City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> retaken by the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in 30 days, <hi>Anno</hi> 1099. after it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the hands of the barbarous <hi>Infidels</hi> for the ſpace of 409 years, and ſo great was the joy conceived by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who inhabited it, and had ſuffered miſerable Perſecution under the <hi>Turks,</hi> that they embraced the Souldiers, weeping for gladneſs, and every where ſinging praiſes for their deliverance.</p>

               <p>By this time the <hi>Tartars</hi> warring in the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> had driven <hi>Jathanites</hi> out of all his Dominions, whereupon he fled to the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor for aid, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge; but ingrateful as he was, not regarding the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he had received at his Hands, when he fled from <hi>Theodorus</hi> the Emperor, he committed him Priſoner at large to the City of <hi>Aenus</hi> in <hi>Thrace,</hi> appointing ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to watch him ſo narrowly that he ſhould not eſcape.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Kingdom being thus ſettled in <hi>Aſia, Archanes</hi> conſulted with his Son <hi>Solyman</hi> about getting footing in <hi>Europe,</hi> which he promiſed to effect; and upon his return to his Government, ſent over <hi>Ezes-Bey</hi> his chief Captain, and ſome others to diſcover the Country; who taking a <hi>Greek</hi> Priſoner returned and preſented him to <hi>Solyman,</hi> who having given him Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Rayment, inquired of the Nature of the Country, who informed them at large: Whereupon repaſſing with a ſmall Force, they ſeized upon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Zembenick,</hi> without doing any harm to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, which was indeed but ſmall; moſt of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone out to fetch in their Harveſt.</p>
               <p>The News of the <hi>Turks</hi> landing in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſoon flew to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but ſuch was their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardiſe and Sloath together with inteſtine Diviſions, that no Care was taken to expulſe them: So that they daily increaſing their Power, by ſuch as were ſent over in Boats, ſeized alſo upon the Caſtle of <hi>Maditas,</hi> and afterward ſpoiled the Country of <hi>Cherſoneſus,</hi> as far as <hi>Callipolis;</hi> which City they took after having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the Governour in a pitched Battle; yet ſo infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57574:65"/>were the greater part of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that they made a jeſt of the proceedings of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were by this time advanced 200 from the Caſtle of <hi>Zembenick,</hi> where they firſt Landed. Whereupon <hi>Solyman</hi> ſent to his Father, to acquaint him with what had paſſed, as likewiſe to deſire him, to ſend him freſh ſupplies of Men, not only to ſecure what he had won, but to proſecute his ſucceſsful beginning; upon the receipe of which news <hi>Orchanes</hi> greatly rejoyced, and immediately Commanded 1000 <hi>Sarazens</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> to paſs the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> in Boats prepared for that purpoſe, upon whoſe Arrival <hi>Solyman</hi> intercepted the Goveronour of <hi>Conger</hi> Caſtle, who had greatly annoyed the <hi>Turks,</hi> and ſtriking off his Head before the Caſtle-Gate ſo terrified thoſe that were within, that they ſoon ſurrendred the Place, from whence the <hi>Turks</hi> frequently ſallying fetched in great Booties, venturing even to the Walls of <hi>Didymotichum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus in the ſpace of one year, the <hi>Turks</hi> got ſtrong footing in <hi>Europe,</hi> poſſeſſing themſelves of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Caſtles and Towns, with the Countries about them; which <hi>Solyman</hi> as a reward of their Service, gave to his Captains and Soldiers, as appeareth by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of <hi>Ezes-Beg,</hi> and <hi>Fazel-Beg</hi> the firſt, Two <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Captains that ſet Footing in <hi>Europe,</hi> but for a while a ſtop was put to the <hi>Turks</hi> Progreſs, occaſioned by the Death of <hi>Solyman;</hi> who hawking in the Fields of <hi>Bolyre,</hi> and following too furious in taking a Ditch, his Horſe threw him where he received ſuch a mortal bruiſe, that he within a few days after died, which News coming to his Father <hi>Orchanes,</hi> he for grief fell ſick, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two Months gave up the Ghoſt, <hi>Anno</hi> 1359. and of his Age 80 years, having Reigned 31 years.</p>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57574:66"/>in <hi>Europe,</hi> as a place from whence he might beſt annoy <hi>Christendom,</hi> and then ſending for his Captains, he Commanded to invade the Countries of <hi>Philipopolis, Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gora,</hi> and <hi>Ipſala;</hi> the which in a ſnort time they brought under Subjection.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Kingdom in a ſmall time being ſpread wide, <hi>Cura Ruſtemes</hi> the Doctor of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law, and <hi>Zinderlu Chelil</hi> the Chief Juſtice deviſed the Order or Conſtitution of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> (which have ever ſince been available to <hi>Turks</hi> in all their Wars) after this manner, that ſeeing there were great multitudes of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Captives frequently taken, the Youths above fifteen years of Age ſhould every fifth be the Kings, and if there wanted of five, then he who had them ſhoud pay twenty five Aſpers a Head, and that thoſe which appertained to the Kind ſhould for three of four years be put to hard Labour, the better to inure 'um to Hardſhip; and then being brought to Court to ſerve in the Wars, as the Kings Life-Guard being alway near his Perſon.

               <p>With this overthrow of his Men, <hi>Amurath</hi> was greatly inraged, and gathering all his Power marched into <hi>Servia</hi> (which before he had Relinquiſhed upon the Deſpots becoming his Tributary) where he found the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> with a formidable Army ready to receive him; when after ſome Towns and Caſtles taken, on either ſide, both Armies met upon the great Plains of <hi>Coſſovia,</hi> where when the Captains on either ſide had put their Men in Order; exhorting them to do their beſt for obtaining the Victory, they joyned with ſuch Fury that the Earth trembled under their Feet, and ſuch was the horrid noiſe of Claſhing Arms, ſhouts of the Conquerors Cries, of the Vanquiſhed and Weeing of Horſes, that wild Beaſts in the Mountains trembled; and thoſe that beheld the Fight ſuppoſed that ſhowers of Arrows deſcended from the Clouds. At firſt the <hi>Turks</hi> gave back, being aſſailed by the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in great number, and the Right Wing rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but <hi>Bajazet</hi> coming in with a freſh Power renewed the Battle, which having continued eight hours with

               <p>After the Battle was over, <hi>Amurath</hi> greatly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in his huge Conqueſt, in a Vain-glorious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour would needs take a view of the heaps of the dead Carcaſſes, which made the Plain Mountainous, when as a half dead Soldier, named <hi>Cobelits</hi> faint with loſs of Blood and Wounds, riſing as it were from the Grave, came towards him ſtaggering and falling three or four times in twenty paces, when thoſe that were about him, would have hindered his approach; but <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> (Deſtiny ſo ordering) Commanded he ſhould have acceſs, ſuppoſing he would have Petitioned for his Life; when on the contrary without a Word ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Cobelits</hi> drawing forth a Dagger, ſtabbed him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Belly, for which he was preſently hewn in pieces; nor did <hi>Amurath</hi> long ſurvive him, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three days after dyed of his Wound, and was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in <hi>Pruſia, Anno</hi> 1390. of his Age 68 years, and of his Reign 31 years.

               <p>
                  <hi>BAjazet</hi> a man of a Proud and haughty temper, having taken upon him the Regency of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Kingdoms, fell heavily upon <hi>Servia,</hi> not ſo much as vouchſafing to hear the Embaſſadors ſent on their behalf, which made the Princes of the Weſt begin to conſider their own eſtate, and eſpecially <hi>Vincelaus</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Emperor, and <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and not contented with the ſpiols of <hi>Servia,</hi> he made ſeveral inroads into <hi>Boſan,</hi> ſpoiling the Country and carrying away great booties, when in the mean while the King of <hi>Caramania</hi> hearing of his Fathers death, began anew to waſte his Countries in <hi>Aſia,</hi> which cauſed <hi>Bajazet</hi> to ſend a great power, who overthrew him and recovered all that was loſt taking from him likewiſe his own Country which obliged him in humble wiſe to beg their reſtauration, which <hi>Bajazet</hi> upon condition that he ſhould from that time forward become his vaſſal reſtored.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> the only City the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had in <hi>Aſia,</hi> was beſieged by <hi>Bajazets</hi> Power, and after a ſtraight Siege and no hopes of any ſuccours, delivered by the Citizens as a ranſom for their Lives and Perſons.</p>
               <p>Having ſubdued <hi>Servia,</hi> and the greateſt part of <hi>Boſan,</hi> he invaded <hi>Theſſalia</hi> waſting it as he paſſed with fire and Sword, even to the Walls of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:57574:69"/>taking <hi>Neopolis</hi> in <hi>Greece;</hi> and <hi>Joannia</hi> in <hi>Aetolia,</hi> and afterward returning into <hi>Aſia</hi> he there ſpent the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but Spring being come, with all his Power he repaſſed the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and lay'd cloſe Siege to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the ſeat of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel Paleologus</hi> then Reigning, who after he had been brought to great extremity, went to the <hi>German</hi> Emperors Court to crave aid, who together with many other <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, ſent an Army of 250000 under the leading of young <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> to oppoſe whom <hi>Bajazet</hi> raiſed his Siege and found them beſieging <hi>Neocopolis;</hi> from whence they drew into the great Plain and joyned Battle, but by reaſon of the confuſion that was in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army, their Van being overcharged, the Rear fled without ſtriking a ſtroak, ſo that the <hi>Turks</hi> getting the Victory with a far leſs number purſued ſo hard upon the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that the greater part of the Army was ſlain, taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners and drowned in paſſing the River <hi>Danu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this great and unexpected Victory over the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> occaſioned by the emulation that aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their great Commanders, <hi>Bajazet</hi> returned to the Siege of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> now out of all hope to be relieved, where whilſt he lay caſting his eyes upon <hi>Deſpina,</hi> the ſlain <hi>Deſpot</hi> of <hi>Servia</hi>'s fair Daughter, offered by her Mother; his former Wife being dead he Married her, and for her ſake reſtored to her Brother <hi>Stephen</hi> all his fathers Principalities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aladin</hi> the <hi>Carramanian</hi> King being dead, and his Son of the ſame name Reigning in his ſtead, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to revenge the wrong <hi>Bajazet</hi> had done his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Subjects, coming to <hi>Aucyra</hi> ſurpriſed <hi>Temurtaſſes Bajazet</hi>'s great Lievtenant, but upon the approach of <hi>Bajazet</hi> with his Army he richly arraying begged his pardon, and ſet him at liberty, ſending Embaſſadors to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57574:70"/>excuſe them; but <hi>Bajazet</hi> would not ſuffer them to come into his ſight, whereupon the young King gathering all the Power of his Country, fought with him a great Battle, but being far too weak for ſuch an Enemy was overthrown &amp; he taken Priſoner, &amp; by the Command of <hi>Bajazet</hi> delivered to <hi>Temurtaſes</hi> his Capital Enemy, who for the diſgrace he had put upon him cauſed him to be ſtrangled, which raſh deed much grieved <hi>Bajazet,</hi> the young Prince being his Siſters Son, yet he ſeized upon the greateſt part of his Kingdom, though he had ſeveral Sons living, and ſo inraged was he that he expulſed all the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Princes in Leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> and ſeized upon their Territories, whereupon they fled to <hi>Tamerlane</hi> the Great, who having Married the daughter of the Cham or Emperor of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and now returned from the Conqueſt of <hi>China,</hi> he took them into his protection, and being at the ſame time Solicited for aid by <hi>Emanuel</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, he ſent to <hi>Bajazet</hi> his Embaſſadors, with many rich pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, requeſting him to ceaſe from moleſting his Allies, but he in a proud manner not only rejected his preſents, but with many opprobrious words, caſt foul reproaches on him, telling his Embaſſadors that he deſired nothing more then to meet him in the field, and with many taunting expreſſions diſmiſſed them. The report of which ſo throughly netled the <hi>Tartar,</hi> that he reſolved with a puiſſant Army to go againſt him, being hightened thereto by <hi>Axalla</hi> his great favourite, a <hi>Genoway</hi> by birth, and friend to the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, whoſe cauſe he daily ſolicited. And <hi>Tamerlane</hi> who was a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſher to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in his opinion differing little from them ſo well approved of all he ſaid, and having taken his leave of his Father-in-Law, and his Wife, with a powerful Army he paſſed the Mountains, March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through many Countries, none daring oppoſe his paſſage, till at length coming to <hi>Bachichich,</hi> he muſtered
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57574:70"/>his Army, and found it to conſiſt of 800000 Horſe and Foot of divers Nations, to whom he gave gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pay, not having ſuffered the leaſt wrong to be done in any Country, through which he had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> lying at the Siege of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and hearing the <hi>Tartar</hi> approached with a Power that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Countries as he paſſed, he raiſed his Siege, and contrary to <hi>Tamerlains</hi> Expectation, but even as he wiſhed, came over with ſuch forces as he could raiſe, into <hi>Aſia;</hi> where he joyned with his Livete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whilſt the <hi>Tartars</hi> ſtill came on, having by this time paſſed <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and taken all the Cities in their way, that appertained to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and amongſt the reſt the great City of <hi>Sabaſtia,</hi> once the chief Seat of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Sultan, utterly raſing it, putting all the Citizens to the Sword, or as ſome, Buryed them alive in deep Pits he cauſed to be digged for that purpoſe, unleſs the Governour whom he ſet at Liberty to carry the News to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing 500000 Strong, who upon the Governours coming into his preſence, demanded which was the greater Army he having ſeen both, to which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having craved pardon, he replyed that the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> Army muſt needs be the greateſt: by Reaſon he was Lord of far greater Countries; whereupon <hi>Bajazet</hi> Laughing, ſaid out of doubt the ſight of the <hi>Tartars</hi> hath made this Coward ſo affraid, that he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every Enemy two.</p>
               <p>The Armies being come near to each other upon the great Plains of <hi>Sennas,</hi> he thought not good to joyn Battle preſently by Reaſon the Evening ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached; yet many light Skirmiſhes happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Parthian</hi> Horſemen, and the Forerunners of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army; but the next Morning either Hoaſt being ſet in Array, after ſome Pauſe the charge
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57574:71"/>was Sounded, whereupon the Prince of <hi>Ciarcan Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marlin</hi>'s Kinſ-man, with 40000 Horſe charged the <hi>Turks</hi> in the Front, and Piercing their Battle, put the <hi>Jannizaries</hi> into diſorder; but venturing too far was there Slain, whereupon <hi>Axalla</hi> Leading the Vaunt-Guard compoſed of <hi>Sciths</hi> and <hi>Parthians,</hi> bore upon the left Wing of the <hi>Turks</hi> Army, cutting in pieces and Bearing down all that oppos'd him, at what time his Footmen coming to joyn with him he Faced the <hi>Batalion</hi> of the <hi>Jnnaizaries;</hi> who behaved themſelves Valiantly for the ſafety of their Prince, who in the middle of them Fought on Foot, which Fight continued Bloody, and doubtful for the ſpace of an Hour, all the place being heaped with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Slain; till at laſt the <hi>Tartars</hi> being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged gave Ground, which <hi>Tamerlain</hi> from his Stand perceiving ſent 10000 Horſe to Reinforce them, and other 10000 to Fight in the Rearward, and at the ſame time ſent his Foot-men, who fell in with the <hi>Turks</hi> main Battle that remained yet unſhaken with ſuch fury, that making them give way, he opened them to the Rear of the <hi>Jannizaries;</hi> wherein was yet the Perſon of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who ſuſtained the greateſt Brunt of the Fight, but at laſt overpowered with number, they were forced to give Gronnd, at what time <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlain</hi> coming on with 50000 freſh Horſe, Bore down all before him till he came to the <hi>Jannizaries</hi> (who always Fight in the Heart of the Army) and they weary, and not able to make ſufficient reſiſtance, were trodden down on all ſides, ſo that the Battle Swer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, the <hi>Turks</hi> betook themſelves to Flight, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt <hi>Bajazet</hi> wounded as he was, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards fell into the Hands of <hi>Axalla,</hi> together with his Son <hi>Muſa.</hi> The Deſpot of <hi>Servia</hi> and many others of note.</p>
               <p>This great Victory fell to the <hi>Tartars</hi> chiefly, by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57574:71"/>the revolt of a great number of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s men; who were raiſed in the Countries of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Princes expulſed, who in the Heat of the Battle, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their natural Lords under <hi>Tamerline</hi>'s Standard went over to 'um.</p>
               <p>This Fight laſted Bloody and doubtful from Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Morning till four in the Evening, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as many report 200000 on either ſide were Slain, and amongſt the reſt <hi>Muſtapha Bajazets</hi> Son with moſt of his great Commanders.</p>
               <p>After this <hi>Bajazet</hi> being brought before <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> and demanded why he oppreſſed the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and made War upon ſo Noble a Prince as was the Emperor of <hi>Greece;</hi> to which he replyed, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the ſame thing that hath moved thee to invade me, even the deſire of Glory and Soveraignty; and why, ſaid <hi>Tamerlain,</hi> do you uſe ſuch Tyranny over thoſe you Conquer without Reſpect of Sex or Age? That I did, ſaid he, to give the greater Terror to my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Ah what wouldſt thou have done with me, ſaid <hi>Tamerlain,</hi> if it had been thy Fortune to have had me in thy Power? I would, ſaid the haughty <hi>Turk</hi> (not Conquered tho overcome) have put thee in a Cage of Iron, and have carryed thee in Triumph about my Kingdom. Even ſo ſaid <hi>Tamerlain,</hi> ſhalt thou be ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thereupon commanded him out of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and as he had determined, ſhortly after Coop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him up in a Cage of Iron, and carryed him into the Countries he Conquered, whoſe Calamity may well ſerve as a memento to all aſpiring Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, by putting them in mind that the Worldly Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not perminent.</p>
               <p>After this the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor ſent his Ambaſſedor to <hi>Tamerlain</hi> in his Name, to deliver up his City and Empire; but he refuſed, ſaying he had Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſufficient of his own, and after having ſeen

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57574:83"/>by Ambition; he reſolved to make War upon the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, and to have the ſooner done, marched to the Walls of <hi>Constantinople</hi> with a great Power, laying Siege to that Imperial City, which had once been Miſtreſs of the World, which he reduced to ſuch Extremity, that the Citizens for meer Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger left no filthy thing uneaten, and at laſt Eat one another; and perceiving none intended to relieve them, they inforced by invincible neceſſity yielded the faireſt City of the World, to the Will of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, having made all the defence that from true Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour could be expected.</p>
               <p>The proud Conqueror entering the City, amidſt his Cups cauſed all the <hi>Grecian</hi> Nobility, the chief Citizens and Nobles of other Nations to be ſlain in his Preſence. <hi>Constantinus Paleologus</hi> the Emperor being before ſlain and Trampled underfoot in the Preſs, as he was indeavouring to eſcape the Imperial City; this taken after a years Siege, <hi>Pera</hi> a City of the <hi>Greeks</hi> oppoſite to it ſurrendred, yet were the Citizens uſed with all manner of Deſpite: And now removing the Imperial Seat from <hi>Hadrianople</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where it has ever ſince remain'd, he repaired the Walls, and ſuch Buildings, as had been demoliſhed by the Fury of the Cannon.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the Captives taken in the City, one of his Commanders preſented unto him one of the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Ladies that Nature ever formed, named <hi>Irene,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nobly deſcended; and for Education not to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralell'd, upon this incomparable Beauty, <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſo doted, that he ſpent whole Days and Nights with her, never thinking his time well ſpent but in her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: So that his warlike Affairs were altogether neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, which cauſed his Captains to murmur againſt him, though they durſt not freely ſpeak their Minds, which <hi>Muſtapha Baſſa,</hi> one that had been bred up

               <p>At this free Speech of the <hi>Baſſas, Mahomet</hi> was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully offended, telling him he was worthy of Death for his unſeaſonable Preſumption; but notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he would pardon him for the good Opinion he had of his Fidelity, Commanding him the next Morning to aſſemble all his Captains, and chief Councellors the next Morning to attend his Pleaſure in his Pallace; which being accordingly done, he came out of his Chamber, leading the fair <hi>Greek</hi> in moſt ſplendid At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, which adding Luſter to her rare Perfections, made her appear more like an Angel then a Mortal; and ſternly demanding of them, Whether if any of them had ſuch an ineſtimable Treaſure, they would not be thrice adviſed e'r they parted with it: To which they all anſwered, that he had with greater reaſon paſſed his time with her, then any man had to find ſault therewith. To which the barbarous Tyrant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, well, but now I Will make you to underſtand how far you have been deceived in me, and that there is no earthly thing that can ſo much blind my Senſes, or bereave me of my Reaſon, as not to ſee or underſtand what beſeemeth my high Calling; yea, I would you ſhould all know that the Honour and Conqueſt of the <hi>Othoman</hi> Kings, my noble Progenitors, is ſo fixed in my breaſt, with ſuch a Deſire in my ſelf to exceed the ſame, as nothing but Death is able to put out of my Remembrance; and having ſo ſaid, he preſently with one of his Hands catching the fair <hi>Greek</hi> by the Hair, and with the other drawing his Scimiter ſmote off her Head, ſhe vainly Crying out for Mercy, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57574:84"/>then taking the bloody Head in his Hand turning to his Captains; ſaid, now by this Judge ye, whether your Emperor is able to Bridle his Affections, or not; and immediately to put this cruel Act out of his Mind, gave order for his Army to march to the Invaſion of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> which he ſoon brought into Subjection, taking moſt of the principal Cities, and putting the Inhabitants to the Sword; but upon the Submiſſion of <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Prince thereof, he reſtored him upon Condition of his becoming Tributary to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire; and afterwards being inamoured of his fair Daughter took her to Wife, and ſoon after hearing of the Death of <hi>George Deſpot</hi> of <hi>Servia,</hi> he ſeized upon his Country; and ſo paſſing on with his Army beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Belgrade,</hi> both by Land and Water, as having a great Fleet upon the River <hi>Danubius,</hi> on whoſe Bank that City is ſeated; which Fleet being incountered by ſeveral Ships of War, ſent by <hi>Humaides</hi> for that purpoſe were ſoon deſtroyed; which ſo inraged the <hi>Turk,</hi> that immediately giving order for the aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the City, his men were beaten off with the loſs of 4000 men, and amongſt the reſt <hi>Curaizis Baſſa</hi> his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant in <hi>Europe,</hi> who making his approach was ſlain with a great Shot; and ſo well did the Valiant <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miades</hi> defend that City, that after many unſucceſsful aſſaults, <hi>Mahomet</hi> was forced to raiſe his Siege, and departed with 40000 leſs then he brought.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mahomet</hi> grieved his Affairs proſpered no better, and finding that by force he could not prevail againſt <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> he dealt underhand by giving great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to his Captains, thinking if he could cauſe them to revolt, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> would eaſily be ſubdued, and ſo effectually he wroght with <hi>Moſes</hi> his chief Captain, and a great Soldier, that in hopes of the Kingdom of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirus</hi> promiſed by <hi>Mahomet;</hi> when <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſhould be ſubdued, and a great maſs of Money, he found means to eſcape to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and after him <hi>Amaſa</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Scanderbeg's</hi> Captains, who were ſent by <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> with great Power to invade <hi>Epirus;</hi> but being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown by the invinſible Prince, they received ſuch cold Comfort at their return, that fearing their Lives, which indeed the <hi>Turk</hi> had a deſign to bereive them off, <hi>Moſes</hi> fled and humbling himſelf at the Feet of his Compaſſionate Prince, he notwithſtanding his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery received him again into his Service, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſerved him faithfully in his Wars, but <hi>Amaze</hi> being overthrown in his expedition with <hi>Iſaac Baſſa,</hi> with the loſs of 20000 <hi>Turks</hi> upon his return, was by the Command of <hi>Mahomet</hi> as moſt Conjectured poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, after which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> concluded a Peace with the <hi>Turks</hi> for a year, and was afterwad continued for a longer time, during which great War happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Turks,</hi> about the ſeizing the Iſlands in the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geum,</hi> and thereby hindering the Traffick in the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teranian,</hi> to the great impoveriſhing their Signiory. Wherefore entering into a Confideracy with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they Arme both by Sea and Land; into which

               <p>The Princes thus Confedrated raiſing great Forces, when in the mean time <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſent <hi>Scremet Baſſa</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> to keep him from joyning with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whoſe Duke <hi>Chriſtopher Maurus</hi> was coming to him, with ten Gallies appointed; with which <hi>Baſſa Scanderbeg</hi> fought, and put him to flight with the loſs of ten Thouſand of his Men, taking the Treaſurer of the Army, and ſix others of Account Priſoners, who were ſpeedily Ranſomed at 40000 Duccats; and greater things had been done, had not the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> dyed of a Fever, upon whoſe Death his Army returned home <hi>Victor Capella;</hi> the next year with the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet, ſeized <hi>Athens, Aulis, Chalchis, Larſum,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Himber:</hi> But attempting to recover <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras</hi> was overthrown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hungary</hi> being deſtitute of ſuch a King as might defend them againſt the Power of the <hi>Turks,</hi> elected <hi>Matthias Corroinus,</hi> the youngeſt Son of <hi>John Huniades</hi> their great Captain deceaſed, who not much inferiour to his Father in valour and ſucceſs in Arms, gave the <hi>Infidels</hi> many a fatal overthrow, with the Loſs of many of their Armies, and gave great hopes to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that he would as indeed he did prove a Bulwark to <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>

               <p>Whilſt things thus paſſed, <hi>Mahomet</hi> deſirous to revenge himſelf of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> fent <hi>Ballabanus</hi> with a great Army to invaide his Territories, whom <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> charging furiouſly overthrew him, but <hi>Moſes</hi> and others of his Captains contrary to the command of their General, in the heat of fight following their Enemies into the ſtraights of the Mountains, where fallen into an Ambuſh for that purpoſe layed, they were taken Priſoners, and carryed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57574:87"/>to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by thoſe they had before Vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wherewith <hi>Sanderbeg</hi> ſent to deſire that he might Ranſom them, but the crafty Tyrant knowing how much he was weakned by ſuch a loſs, cauſed them Cruelly to be flain alive, and ſoon after ſent <hi>Jacup Baſſa</hi> with a great Army, with whom the renowned Prince ingaging, ſlew him hand to hand, and put to the Sword a great part of his Army, upon news of which <hi>Mahomet</hi> mad with Anger, raiſed an Army of 200000 men, thinking to overrun the Country, but in vain, for having a long time layn Siege to <hi>Croia,</hi> and there by the furious Sallies of the Garriſon, and onſets of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> loſt near half his men, together with <hi>Ballabanus</hi> his General, he with great ſhame and confuſion returned to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as all things muſt yield to Fate, ſo our invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Champion, whom no mortal hand could ſubdue, wearyed with the Toils of a tedious War, coming to <hi>Lyſſa</hi> a City of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> fell Sick, and calling the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſador to him, he diſcovered to him what a troubleſome Life he had lived, and by what means the War was to be maintained, recommending to him the care of his Wife and Children, appointing the <hi>Venetians</hi> the Guardians of his Son, till ſuch time he came of Age, and in the mean while to ſecure for him the Kingdom of <hi>Epirus,</hi> admoniſhing him to be faithful and as much as in him lay to maintain peace and unity. Then calling his Wife and Son, told them that he muſt leave the World and exchange this Life for one more durable, and willed her that after his death ſhe ſhould paſs over into <hi>Apulia,</hi> and there to live upon the inheritance given him by King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and then after ſome devout Prayers, gave up the Ghoſt, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1466. in the 63 year of his Age and 24 of his Reign, to the great grief of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, and joy of the <hi>Turks,</hi> whoſe Armys his very name had

After his death he was with great Solemnity buryed in the Cathedral Church at <hi>Lyſſa,</hi> where he reſted till about 9 years after, at what time the <hi>Turks</hi> taking the City dug up his Bones, and happy was he that could get the ſmalleſt piece, which they wore about them ever after as ineſtimable Jewels, ſuperſtitiouſly imagining that whilſt they had them about u'm <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>'s fortune would attend u'm, and that they ſhould be invincible.</p>
               <p>Not long after the Death of this renowned Soldier, the <hi>Hungarians</hi> under the leading of their young King, ſeized upon the Kingdom of <hi>Boſna,</hi> and ſoon rent it from the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, demoliſhing the Caſtles and driving away the Garriſons placed there by <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> at what time the <hi>Venetians</hi> being abroad with a great fleet of Gallies, took divers Cities from the <hi>Turks,</hi> burnt many Villages, and carryed away 2000 Captives into the Country of <hi>Euboea,</hi> now called <hi>Nigroponte,</hi> which ſo inraged <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a great Army to invade that Country, and recover the ſpoil; in order to effect which, he ſent <hi>Mahomet Baſſa</hi> with a fleet of 300 Gallies, whilſt himſelf with a great Army Marched overland, with which the <hi>Venetian</hi> Admiral not daring to ingage it, arrived ſafe, where the <hi>Turks</hi> landing took <hi>Stora Baſaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon,</hi> and Marching to <hi>Chalcis</hi> joyned with the Emperors Army, who with ſmall Veſſels and other Materials, made a Bridge over the ſtraight or narrow Sea, which divides <hi>Euboea</hi> from <hi>Achaia,</hi> ſtraightly beſieging it both by Sea and Land, and with his Cannon for 4 days battered the City inceſſantly, being given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the chief Cannoneer of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>The City being thus gained at the price of 40000 <hi>Turks</hi> Lives the Barbarous Tyrant commanded all that were found therein to be put to the Sword; which <hi>Paulus Ericus</hi> the Governour underſtanding, with his Wiſe, Daughter, and truſty Friends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf to the Caſtle, who capitulated that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſurrender of the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> himſelf, and his Friends

               <p>The great Maſter of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> having notice that <hi>Mahomet</hi> intended to invade his Territories, was like an experienced Captain wanting nothing that might conduce to a reſolute Defence, and having certain No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that <hi>Miſiſtes Baſſa</hi> had Landed his Power, and was marching towards the City, he aſſembled his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and with many Chriſtian and Soldier-like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions admoniſhed them to fight the Battle of the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> againſt his Enemies, which ſo wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that they all reſolved to Live and Dye in his defence.</p>

               <p>By this time <hi>Campſon</hi> having notice of the approach (whom he could not at firſt believe to have paſſed the huge Mountain of <hi>Amanus</hi>) ſtood long in doubt what was beſt to be done, whether to give the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Battle, or to retire to <hi>Damaſco</hi> and protract the War, whilſt freſh Forces could come to his Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: In the latter Opinion <hi>Gazelles</hi> his great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, and Governour of <hi>Apamia</hi> Concurred with him, labouring earneſtly to confirm him in that Opinion,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57574:111"/>but Deſtiny ſo ordering it, he refuſed the good and wholſome Perſwaſions of <hi>Gazelles,</hi> and imbraced that of <hi>Cayerbeius,</hi> which was preſently to give the <hi>Turks</hi> Battle; which Council he gave though he knew it to be Deſtructive, that by ſuch means he might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on the Sultan; who ſome years before had cauſed his Brother to be poiſoned, for deſigning to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of his Empire.</p>
               <p>Battle being reſolved on, and the <hi>Turks</hi> Army com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on <hi>Campſon</hi> divided his Army into four Battles; the firſt whereof he committed to <hi>Cayerbeius</hi> the Traitor, the ſecond to <hi>Sybeius</hi> the Governour of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſco,</hi> a man of ſingular Faith and Valour; theſe two were appointed at once to Charge both Wings of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army, the third was lead by <hi>Gazelles,</hi> and the laſt by <hi>Campſon</hi> himſelf, who ſtayed with it for the defence of the Camp: Nor was <hi>Selymus</hi> Idle, for he had placed the <hi>Aſian</hi> Horſemen in the right Wing, and the <hi>European</hi> in the left, and in the middle the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and Artillery before, whom between the two Wings, he had placed his Pentioners all moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert, and valiant Soldiers, and in this Order the <hi>Turks</hi> always fight, if the Ground will admit ſo to Marſhall the Army.</p>
               <p>Both Armies being thus ſet in Order, the Charge was ſounded; whereupon <hi>Cayerbeius</hi> with his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron Charged the <hi>European</hi> Horſemen with great Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but reſolving to betray his truſt by and by, Wheeling off fell upon the <hi>Sullians</hi> and ſuch other Slaves as kept the Baggage, making ſome ſmall ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that as a Valiant and cunning Traitor, he might at the ſelf ſame time ſatisfie the Expectation of his Valour, and of his Treaſon; but <hi>Sybeius</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Damaſco</hi> dealt otherwiſe, for entering over-thwart the Ranks in the right Wing of the <hi>Turks</hi> Army; he with his <hi>Mamalukes</hi> Charged with ſuch fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

Nor could <hi>Muſtapha Baſſa</hi> with all his Courage reſiſt the Fury of the <hi>Mamalukes,</hi> all the <hi>Turks</hi> being filled with Fear and Conſternation, as well on the hither as the further Bank; the Artillery was for a while rendered uſeleſs, by reaſon that if it had been diſcharged, it muſt have been againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> onely, who in fearful Troops covered the further Bank, calling for Help to thoſe on the other ſide; <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymus</hi> ſeeing in what ſtate Aſſairs ſtood, cauſed all his Boats to be brought, and filling them with <hi>Janizaries</hi> paſſed them over, who Ranging in good order ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Fury of the <hi>Mamalukes;</hi> when as <hi>Carrgolis</hi> Son to the <hi>Tartar</hi> King, and Brother-in-Law to <hi>Selymus,</hi> with his Horſemen took the Water and Swom over with little loſs: So that now the Battle went hard on all ſides, and ſtrongly did the <hi>Mamalukes</hi> preſs on to gain the Head of the Bridg; the which they had done by Cutting the Cables that faſtened it, they had ſet it afloat down the River, and deſtroyed that part of the Army, with whom they were ingaged, e'r they could have been relieved by their Fellows; which <hi>Muſtapha</hi> perceiving, had drawn to that place both
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57574:117"/>his Inſigns, and his moſt experienced Soldiers, ſo that the Fight was for a long time maintianed Bloody and doubtful, but the <hi>Turks</hi> ſtill coming over in great abundance, true Valour was obliged to give place to Multitudes; for the <hi>Mamalukes</hi> who had done all that men could do, betook themſelves to Flight; after whom the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Horſemen followed with great Slaughter, as likewiſe did <hi>Muſtapha Gazeles,</hi> and <hi>Cayrebeius, Selymus</hi> being deſirous of nothing more then that <hi>Tomombeius</hi> might fall into his Hands, which at length fell out according to his wiſh; for, the next Day he was overtaken, when making head with his ſlender Train, he Fought right valiantly, but at length overcome he again fled, yet ſo ſtrict was <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymus</hi> his command, that the great Captains ſtill purſued him, denouncing all manner of Torture to the poor Villagers, if they did not ſo watch the paſſages of the great Marſh, whereinto he was entered, that he ſhould by no means eſcape; whereupon on the third day finding himſelf hard beſet on everyſide, he willingly gave his followers leave to forſake him, and laying aſide his Inſigns of Royalty hid himſelf amongſt the Flags and Buſhes, ſtanding up to the Neck in Water, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found by the Country Peaſants, he was drawn thence and delivered to the <hi>Baſſa Muſtapha,</hi> who brought him together with ſeveral of his Captains to <hi>Cair,</hi> where <hi>Selymus</hi> reſolving before hand to put him to Death, thereby to appeaſe the Ghoſts of his ſlain Ambaſſadors would not admit him to his preſence, but commanded him to be delivered to the Tormentors, that with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite torments they might make him reveal the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>Campſon Gourus,</hi> ſuppoſed by him to have been hid, all which he indured with a manly courage and ſtern Countenance, uttering nothing unbeſeeming his Character, after which he in tattered Garments with his Hands bound behind him, being ſet upon a lean
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57574:118"/>Ill-favoured Camel, was in diviſion carryed through all the Publick places of the City to be Gazed at as a Spectacle of Miſery, by thoſe who not a Month be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had honoured with profound Reverence, as their great &amp; mighty King, now by the hand of Fortune thrown from the top fo all worldly honour, into the Abyſs of extreameſt Miſery, and in this manner the inſulting <hi>Turks</hi> having brought him to the chief Gate of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, extended their cruelty yet farther by ſtrangling him with a Rope, and that he might be the better ſeen of all that paſſed by, Hanged him upon a hook under the Gate; nor did any of the Princes of the <hi>Mamalukes</hi> who fell into the <hi>Turks</hi> Hands fare otherwiſe.</p>

               <p>You heard (ſacred Fellows in Arms, and Valiant Citizens of <hi>Rhodes</hi>) theſe imperious and ſorrowful Letters, whereunto how we are to anſwer, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth no great deliberation; we muſt as reſolute men either yield or dye, all hopes of Victory is gone, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept forrain aid come ſpeedily to our Succour; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you will follow my Counſel, let us with Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in our Hands until the laſt Gaſp and ſpending the laſt drop of our Blood like Valiant men, defend our Faith and Nobility, received from our Anceſtors, and the honour which we have of long time gotten, both at home and abroad, and let it never be ſaid that our honour dyed but with our ſelves.</p>
               <p>This Speech was approved of by all the Knights of the Order, and moſt of the Soldiers, but the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens looking back upon their Wives, Children, and Wealth, ſtood mute for a good while, but at length Pity working in their Breſt, they humbly beſought
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57574:125"/>the Great Maſter; that he would yet have Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on them, and accept of the Tyrants reaſonable Conditions, ſince Fame ſufficient had been won by their doing all that men were capable of performing, and that they would yet hazard their Lives to the utmoſt, if they perceived any hopes of defending the City, or that any forain aid in time would come to their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but ſince neither of them were to be expected it was but reaſonable to yield to inevitable neceſſity. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe and many the like Arguments, and others of the reſolute Soldiers, and Commanders on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it was concluded that the City was not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being defended by ſo ſmall a Power, againſt ſuch a numerous Army, whereupon Meſſengers were ſent to require a Truce for 4 Days, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly granted, during which time the <hi>Turks</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming on the Truce, came in great number to View the Works, at which <hi>Fornovius</hi> a French man being greatly offended, in a great heat without any command from the Great Maſter, cauſed a Fire of Artillery to be diſcharged amongſt the thickeſt of them; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they pretending a Breach of Truce on the part of the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> thruſt in at the Breach in great Troops, but after a ſharp Skirmiſh were forced to retire, in revenge whereof one of the <hi>Turks</hi> Fencers having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken 3 <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> cut off their Hands, Noſes and Ears, and in that poſture ſent them into the City, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning within 4 Days to ſerve the Great Maſter after the ſame manner; yet <hi>Solyman</hi> diſſembling the matter, ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſwore to the Articles of Peace brought to him for that purpoſe by <hi>Nicholas Vergotus,</hi> and <hi>Georgius Sandriticus,</hi> which were to this Effect; That the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſhould remain unto the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> inviolate, that no Children ſhould be taken from their Parents, or any <hi>Christians</hi> be inforced to imbrace the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Superſtition: That ſuch <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as were Contented to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57574:126"/>remain in the City, might ſo do at their Pleaſure, and that ſuch as would depart, might have Liberty ſo to do with all their Subſtance, to be furniſhed with Convenient Shipping, Proviſion, and Ordnance as far as <hi>Creet,</hi> that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould appoint a reaſonable Day for their Departure, and that in Conſideration thereof, the City to be delivered up to ſuch as <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſhould appoint to take Poſſeſſion thereof.</p>
               <p>Upon the afore-mentioned Articles, though they were not all obſerved by the <hi>Turks;</hi> the City was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up <hi>Anno</hi> 1522. after it had indured ſix Months Siege, and coſt <hi>Solyman</hi> the Lives of 80000 of his Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, having been in the Poſſeſſion of the Knights of the Order 214 years: Upon which the great Maſter being for his Gravity, Virtue, and Valour highly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and applauded by the Conqueror imbarked (together with the Knights of his Order, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as would accompany him) and the Gallies for that purpoſe ready in the Port, and ſailed to <hi>Meſina,</hi> where he was joyfully received, and after invited to the Courts of moſt of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, having with Indignation refuſed <hi>Solyman</hi>'s great Offer made to him, provided he would have accompanied him to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and have ſpent the remainder of his Days in his Service.</p>
               <p>And thus for want of Relief (the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes at that time being at Variance amongſt themſelves) the famous <hi>Rhodes</hi> was loſt, where <hi>Solyman</hi> having ſtayed awhile to ſettle his Affairs appointed a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and ſo breaking up his Army returned to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where for the ſpace of three years he lived Peaceably, giving himſelf up to all manner of Pleaſures; but at the end thereof perceiving the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcord amongſt the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, managed by Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſixth to grow hot (a fatal over-ſight that ever gave the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Kings and Emperors oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity

               <p>After this great great Victory obtained, <hi>Solyman</hi> having moſt of the ſtrong Cities delivered into his Poſſeſſion; gave the Kingdom to <hi>Joannes Sepuſius <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ayvod</hi> of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> and taking with him ſuch things of Price as he thought convenient, leaving two of his <hi>Baſſas</hi> with flying Armies on the Frontiers, he returned to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but he was no ſooner departed and <hi>John</hi> Crowned by the Conſent of the remainder of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Nobility (who durſt do no other for fear of the <hi>Turks</hi>) but <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> laid Claim to the Kingdom, and to make his Title more apparent, ſent his Ambaſſadors to the Courts of divers <hi>Christian</hi> Princes, to declare from whom he derived his Claim; when aided by <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor his Brother, he entered <hi>Hungary</hi> with a great Army, and without any conſiderable Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance took the ſtrong City of <hi>Buda;</hi> at what time ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Hungarians</hi> joyned with him, as not in the

               <p>King <hi>John</hi> by the means aforeſaid thruſt of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, grew extreme impatient, and often conſulted with <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> King of <hi>Polonia</hi> to re-in-throne him in his Kingdom, offering to bear the Charge of the War; but the Pole being already in League with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> would not ſeem unleſs underhand to favour <hi>John,</hi> but wiſhed him to take counſel with <hi>Hieronymus Laſcus</hi> a great Politician, what was beſt to be done in his Affairs, the which <hi>Laſcus</hi> adviſed him to crave Aid of <hi>Solyman</hi> now at Leaſure to aſſiſt him; and urged ſo many Reaſons for it, that he was content to ſend him his Ambaſſador to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who there with Treaſure and fair Speeches, ſo allured the <hi>Baſſas</hi> of the Court to ſecond him in his Requeſt, that <hi>Solyman</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed again to enter <hi>Hungaria</hi> with a puiſſant Army, and by the Inſinuation of this ſly Councellor, that when King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſent Ambaſſadors to him, to make out his Title, by which he laid Claim to the Kingdom, he would ſcarcely give them Audience; and when he did, inſtead of an Anſwer to their Ambaſſy, he Herauld-like denounced againſt their King, all the

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57574:153"/>their power he returned again to his faithleſs Maſter, and related what he had in charge; whereupon the Great Fleet before prepared for the invaſion of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi> put to Sea, <hi>Muſtapha Baſſa</hi> being General of all the Forces, and within a while ſtood with the ſaid Iſland, where the greedy <hi>Turks</hi> landing, ſpoiled ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goodly Villages, and after ſome deliberation having by priſoners taken, underſtood the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Countrey, and of what ſtrength the Iſlanders were, reſolved to beſiege <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> a City ſtanding in the midſt of the Iſland, in a plain and Champain ground, being in circuit about five miles, incompaſſed with a ſtrong wall, defended by eleven ſtrong Bulwarks, and three great Fortreſſes, raiſed by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the Governour of which was <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaus Dandalus,</hi> a man too weak for ſo great a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, as having been alwayes brought up in civil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; in Gariſon were 8000 horſe and foot, but moſt of them raw ſoldiers, and not acquainted with Martial diſcipline, too few to oppoſe ſo powerful an Army as the Baſſa drew after him, which conſiſted of near 150000 horſe and foot.</p>
               <p>On the 22 of <hi>July Anno</hi> 1569 the Baſſa with his Army Encamped within a mile and half of the City, covering with their Tents the hill called <hi>Mandia,</hi> and with incredible labour bringing their Trenches from far, caſt up ſeveral Forts which they raiſed ſo high, that they overlooked the walls of the City, and from their Mounts terribly battered the walls with ſeventy pieces of great Artillery, whoſe dreadful thundring made the earth to tremble, and having by this time run their Trenches to the brim of the ditch, hotly aſſaulted the City in ſeveral places, which was as valiantly defended by the beſieged, inſomuch that the ditches were well nigh filled on that ſide with the bodies of the ſlain, and what was

               <p>During theſe paſſages the <hi>Venetians</hi> having leagued with the Pope, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſeveral of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, prepared their fleet, conſiſting in all of one hundred and ſeventeen ſail; but whiles they lingered for the Additional Forces of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the plague ſo raged amongſt the Marriners and Souldiers, that twenty thouſand dyed e'r its fury was abated, and amongſt them many men of account, but it ceaſing, and the ſummer half ſpent, the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Admiral no longer expecting the coming of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſailed to <hi>Corcyra,</hi> and there calling a Council, it was reſolved they ſhould paſs over to <hi>Cyprus</hi> and deſtroy the <hi>Turks</hi> fleet; but in the height of this expedition dyed <hi>Petrus Loridanus</hi> Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> Leaving the care of the war to <hi>Aloyſius Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenicus,</hi> who ſucceeded him in the Dukedom.</p>

               <p>The new Admiral of the <hi>Venetians</hi> to get him a name reſolving to attempt ſomething upon the Turks, and having a fit opportunity offered he ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Bay of <hi>Ambriaca,</hi> and by the aid of the Mountain people inhabiting. <hi>Acroceraunian</hi> took the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Chimaera</hi> putting to the Sword and taking Priſoners 300 Turks there ingarriſoned, and not long after <hi>Querinus</hi> the Vice-Admiral ſailing along the Coaſt of <hi>Peloponeſus,</hi> Landed his men near the Bay of <hi>Maine,</hi> and in five hours took a ſtrong Caſtle of the Turks, built to guard the paſs, and in it 500 Turks, whom he cauſed to be put to the Sword, and taking out the Ordinance cauſed the Caſtle to be razed.

In which ſpace after many terrible aſſaults, and the loſs of 14000 Turks, <hi>Tramoguſta</hi> was taken, and all manner of cruelties exerciſed (contrary to the Faith of the Baſſa before given) on the Souldiers and Citizens, and the ſame riſque ſoon after run all the other Cities of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> but by this time the Ambaſſadors ſent by the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to <hi>Tamas</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> King to joyn in League with the Confederate Princes being returned, with onely this anſwer, that the <hi>Perſian</hi> would not haſtily

               <p>By this time the Turks having poſſeſſed themſelves of the famous Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and not content therewith gaped for <hi>Crete,</hi> now called <hi>Candia,</hi> lying in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and once as <hi>Seneca</hi> and others witneſs poſſeſſed of 100 Cities, being exceeding fruitful, and then in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> on which the Turks landing in great number, did what harm they poſſibly could, by burning and ſpoiling all they found in their way, till at length they were incountered by <hi>Franciſous Juſtinianus</hi> who but a little before their Landing came into the Iſland with a 1000 Souldiers, and now joyning with the Iſlanders, charged them as they diſperſed to ſeek for prey with ſuch fury, that killing many of them he obliged the reſt to make a ſwift though a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly retreat to their Gallies, but the next day they again landing in greater number burnt divers Towns, ranſacked <hi>Setia</hi> and <hi>Rhetimo,</hi> wherein they found much riches, and carried away moſt of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants into miſerable bondage. But loaded with their booty diſperſed and dreading no danger they were ſuddainly charged by <hi>Lucas Michael</hi> a valiant Captain 2000 of them ſlain, and all the prey reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered together with the priſoners, and they again forced to betake themſelves to their Gallies, after which they weighed Anchor and ſailed along the Coaſt, paſſing by <hi>Cythera, Zazinthius</hi> and <hi>Cephalemia</hi>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57574:157"/>inſtantly had been to joyn the Enemy.</p>
               <p>During this preparation of the Chriſtians the Turks were not idle, but calling a Council of the chief Commanders held a long debate, whether they ſhould give the Chriſtians Battle, or decline it, but at length thoſe that held it dangerous to give Battle being over-ballanced by thoſe that were of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, it was reſolved that the whole Fleet ſhould be put in order of Battle, which at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Haly</hi> Baſſa, General of the Land Forces, and Great Admiral of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gallies, coming out of the Bay of <hi>Corinth</hi> or <hi>Lepanto,</hi> they were put into order of the Battle after this manner. The middle Battle in number much like the Chriſtians, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by <hi>Haly</hi> Baſſa and <hi>Partau,</hi> attended upon by <hi>Agan</hi> Maſter of the Turks Arſenal, <hi>Muſtapha Zelibi</hi> the Treaſurer, <hi>Achmat Bay</hi> with <hi>Mahomet</hi> his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brother, the ſons of <hi>Haly Achmat Aga</hi> Governor of <hi>Teuthrania, Aſſis Caiga</hi> Governour of <hi>Calipolis, Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coza Caſſanes</hi> Son to <hi>Barbaroſſa Malamur</hi> Governour of <hi>Mytilene, Dely Solyman Gider</hi> Captain of <hi>Chios, Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſambeius</hi> Governour of the <hi>Rhodes, Provi Aga</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Nauplium, Giaper Zelibi</hi> Preſident of <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria, Dordagnan Dondomeni,</hi> with many others too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to recite. The right wing was by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Baſſa's commanded by <hi>Mahomet Bey,</hi> with 56 Gallies, to whom were joyned many Captains of great Experience in Sea affairs. The left wing was commanded by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>luzales</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Argiers,</hi> an old experienced Pirate compoſed of 90 Gallies, accompanyed with <hi>Cariolo,</hi> and <hi>Araby,</hi> his two ſons, attended on by a multitude of Pirates who entered into the War, in hopes to get great ſpoil. In the Rearward was placed <hi>Amurath Dragut</hi> with 30 Gallies, and divers other ſmall veſſels.</p>
               <p>Both Fleets being ſet in order of Battle, about
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57574:158"/>noon a fierce <hi>ingagement</hi> happened in the beginning of which God ſo ordering it, the Wind turned about to the great advantage of the Chriſtians, driving the ſmoake of the great Ordnance, and vollies of ſmall ſhot in the face of the Infidels, whereupon for a long time the fight continued with equal ſucceſs, victory inclining to neither ſide, but after four hours ſpace the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Admiral being ſlain, his Gally taken, and about 40 others ſunk and fired, victory began to declare her ſelf for the Chriſtians. Yet the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Turks as ſearing <hi>Selymus</hi> Anger if they ſhould return vanquiſhed fought deſperately, but true valour prevailing and all the chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, except <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>luzales</hi> ſlain or taken Priſoners, and he reſolving to reſerve himſelf to his better fortune, fled (after 5 hours deſperately fighting) with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 30 and 40 Gallies into the Bay of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> leaving the victory to the Chriſtians, who having purſued him as far as they thought convenient, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to take the ſpoil, where it was a horrible ſpectacle to behold the Sea coloured with blood, and covered with the bodies of the ſlain, fragments of broken Ships, and ſuch weapons as were ſubject to float upon its ſurface. The number of the Turks loſt in this great overthrow, could not be known by reaſon of the Multitude that were buryed in the Sea, but <hi>Antonius Gnarnaerius</hi> writing the Hiſtory of this war reported 32000 to have periſhed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them theſe of Note, <hi>viz.

               <p>This notable Victory thus obtained, <hi>Don John Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerius</hi> and <hi>Columna</hi> coming together, friendly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced each other, and afterwards in a moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an manner on their knees returned moſt hearty thanks to Almighty God for giving them ſo Great a Victory over the Enemies of his Name; which pious example was ſeconded by all the Captains, Mariners, and ſouldiers of the Fleet of the Chriſtians in this bloody fight died about ſeven thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixty ſix, the chief of which were <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Bernardinus</hi> of the Honourable family of <hi>Cordona</hi> in <hi>Spain, Horatio Caraffa</hi> and <hi>Ferantes Bisballus Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Horatius</hi> Noble <hi>Romans</hi> of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were flain; <hi>Auguſtinus, Barbadicus, Benedictus, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perantius, Vincentius, Quirinus, Johanes Lauritanus, Marinus Contarenus, Catharinus, Malepetra, Georgius, Andreas Barbadicus, Marcus Antonius, Laudus Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Bonus Hieronimus, Contarenus, Antonius Paſchali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and <hi>Hieron Venerius,</hi> all of the Order of the Senators, beſides divers other Honourable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men, well deſerving to be inrolled in the Records of Fame.

               <p>This great and welcom victory publiſhed in the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> cauſed ſuch a General joy as the like was never till that time; nor only did the <hi>Venetians</hi> alone rejoyce, but likewiſe all Chriſtian Nations; for in this fight the <hi>Turks</hi> loſt ſo many ſubſtantial

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>luzales</hi> could not be drawnthereto, having before to his coſt tryed the courage of the Chriſtians lying ſtill in the bay, hoping thereby to gain ſome advantage, without which he reſolved not to fight, but finding the Chriſtians every day ready to charge him as he lay, he for his better ſecurity found means to ſail to <hi>Corona,</hi> upon which the Chriſtian Fleet retired to <hi>Cerigo,</hi> not finding any opportunity of giving the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my battle</p>
               <p>Whilſt matters went thus <hi>Don John</hi> ſent a Frigate to advertiſe the <hi>Venetian</hi> Admiral that he was arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Corcyra,</hi> commanding him to meet him at <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthus,</hi> there to conſult about the carrying on the war; but when they came thither, the General not regarding his word delayed to meet them, which did not a little trouble the <hi>Venetians;</hi> but not ſtaying there they ſailed to <hi>Cocyra,</hi> where joyning the ſhips newly ſent to their Aid by ſeveral Chriſtian Princes, they reſolved to ſeek out the Enemy, and if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to oblige him to fight; whereupon they looſed Anchor, and for the moſt part ſailed by night, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by that means to oppreſs the Enemy e'r he was provided to defend himſelf; but this purpoſe being diſcovered by ſome of the <hi>Turks</hi> Scouts, the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were prevented in their undertaking; yet ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute was the <hi>Venetian</hi> Admiral that he preſſed the other Generals to enter the Bay, and give them Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle even in the mouth of the Harbour; but this his reſolution (though it had paſt doubt proved ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, had it been put in execution) was oppoſed by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> General, and <hi>Columnius</hi> the Popes Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57574:160"/>as not ſeaſonable, but altogether dangerous, even to the hazarding the Chriſtian Fleet, which as they alledge was the Bullwark of Chriſtendom; yet ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before <hi>Nauarinum,</hi> they reſolved to beſiege the Caſtle of <hi>Modon</hi> both by Sea and Land, which Caſtle lying in mouth of the Bay, defended the <hi>Turks</hi> Fleet, whereupon Sailing before it, they landed ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of their moſt reſolute Soldiers, and at the ſame time appointed ſeveral of the Galleaſſes and Gallies to batter it with their Great Ordnance; the which more advantagiouſly to effect they joyned two Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys together, with Maſts, Ropes, and other tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in the nature of a floating battery, on which they planted Baskets of Earth, and ſeveral Pieces of Great Ordnance; but being overcharged with too great a weight, they became uſeleſs, by reaſon of the abundance of water that entred them, and at the ſame time having notice that a conſiderable number of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> horſemen had entered by night into the Caſtle, they thought good to give over the ſiege, which made the <hi>Turks</hi> ſo adventurous as to ſend ſeveral of their Galleys out of the Bay to ſeize upon a great ſhip of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that was coming from <hi>Zacynthus</hi> with proviſion for the Fleet, but they were ſoon obliged to retire, which all of them did in ſafety, except <hi>Mahomet,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſſa</hi> the famous Pirate, who to get him a name, ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on purpoſe to dare the Chriſtians; but being Grapled by the Marqueſs of St. <hi>Crux,</hi> after a fierce Engagement he with almoſt all his men were ſlain, and the Galley taken in the ſight of the <hi>Turks</hi> Fleet, they not daring to come to his aſſiſtance; after which the Chriſtians beſieged the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Nauari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <hi>Venetians</hi> furniſhed with Munition and Victuals for the better performance of that ſervice, which he no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er received, but landing 2000 <hi>Italians,</hi> 1000 <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and five hundred <hi>Germans,</hi> with twelve Pieces of Ordnance, did batter the Caſtles inceſſantly; but not encompaſſing it, as he ought, in the night time a Great number of <hi>Turks</hi> having made their way through a pathleſs Forreſt, entered at an unſuſpected Port, whilſt thoſe of the Garriſon were skirmiſhing with the beſiegers; whereupon the Princes diſpairing to carry it by aſſault, raiſed the ſiege.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> Fleet ſhut up in the Bay of <hi>Modon,</hi> and as it were beſieged by the Chriſtians, by this time felt great want, which cauſed a Peſtilence to rage ſo violently amongſt the Soldiers and Marriners, that many of the Galleys were deſerted, and the reſt ſo ſlenderly manned, and ſo unprovided of neceſſaries, that had the Chriſtian Fleet rode it out a moneth longer before the Bay, the Enemies fleet had fell into their hands almoſt without fighting; but ſuch was the perverſeneſs of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> General, that he would needs return with his Fleet, notwithſtanding all the pregnant reaſons, and arguments the <hi>Venetian</hi> Admiral uſed to perſwade him to the contrary, and ſo reſolutely was he therein, that he reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part not only without the conſent of the <hi>Venetians</hi> but without their privity, he having in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſtrictly commanded all his Captains, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of his Gallies, ſpeedily to weigh Anchor, and to ſtand for the Coaſt of <hi>Sicily;</hi> of which the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral having notice, and not a little troubled thereat, came on board his Galley, and renewed his perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for his ſtay; but finding all arguments vain, he at leaſt requeſted him to ſtay ſo long, till the 2 Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies faſtened together for a floating Battery might be fetched off, and not be left there as a prey, to which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57574:161"/>he hardly conſented, alledging that his victuals fell ſhort, and if he ſhould ſtay longer abroad his Fleet would be oppreſſed with famine, yet promiſed that if he met with the ſhips he had ſent for out of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi> loaden with proviſion, he would inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, but kept not his word, though he incountred them upon the Coaſt of <hi>Corcyra;</hi> ſo that the half ſtarved <hi>Turks,</hi> upon his departure by degrees got out of the Bay, to their no ſmall joy, moſt of them getting in ſafety to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> For after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to <hi>Meſſina,</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> and Popes Admiral departed likewiſe, the one to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the other to <hi>Venice,</hi> having done nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſo great preparations as were ſet forth by the Chriſtian Princes.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Amida</hi> King of <hi>Tunes</hi> being driven out of his Kingdom fled to <hi>Don John</hi> for Aide, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly requeſting him that he would reſtore him to his Kingdom, to which the crafty <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſeemingly hearkned, but having landed his Forces, taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>Tunis</hi> and other ſtrong places, he ſent <hi>Amida</hi> together with his wife and children into <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi> there to remain as priſoners at large, during their lives, and placed <hi>Mahomet</hi> his brother in his ſtead, who by reaſon of his Seniority was rightful Heir to the Kingdom. But withall taking of him a ſolemn Oath, that he ſhould become and from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth remain a vaſſal to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be ready to do whatſoever he commanded, and having beaten the <hi>Turks</hi> and wild <hi>Arabs</hi> out of the Countrey, he built a new Caſtle in the Middle way, between <hi>Culetta</hi> and <hi>Tunes,</hi> and having put a ſtrong Garriſon therein, as likewiſe into <hi>Guletta,</hi> he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Sicilia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> ſinding no truſt to be repoſed in the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and of themſelves too weak to deal with
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57574:161"/>the <hi>Turks,</hi> reſolved if poſſible to conclude an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able peace with <hi>Selymus,</hi> thinking it more for their advantage than to be ſubject to the inſolent humours of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> General; and thereupon after much debate in the Senate houſe it was reſolved that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors ſhould be ſent to ſound the mind of the <hi>Turk;</hi> who as it afterward appeared, was no leſs deſirous of peace then themſelves, though he a long time diſſembled it; whereupon the Ambaſſadors arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> after much debate ſubſcribed the Articles of Peace; the ſubſtance of which were theſe. Firſt, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould pay unto <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limus</hi> 300000 Ducates, 100000 to be paid down, and the reſt in two equal portions the two ſucceeding years. Secondly, That ſuch places of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as were in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the hands of the Poſſeſſors, but that ſuch Towns and Places as the <hi>Venetians,</hi> during the war had taken from the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould be inſtantly reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>This Peace thus concluded, was proclaimed in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> on the twentieth of <hi>March Anno</hi> 1574, and at <hi>Venice</hi> the thirteenth of <hi>April</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the great amazement of the Confederates, when the better to juſtifie themſelves in what they had done, the <hi>Venetian</hi> Senators ſent for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador and Popes Nuncio, into the Senate houſe, to whom the Duke in a Grave Speech, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf to this purpoſe. That anger and Hope two evil Counſellors being ſet aſide, he had concluded a Peace with the <hi>Turk,</hi> not for that he was deſirous of the <hi>Turks</hi> friendſhip, which what account it was to be made of, he right well knew, but for the love he bare to the State, which was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with loſs but even with death it ſelf to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; how he had been ſpoiled of the Kingdom of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57574:162"/>
                  <hi>Cyprus;</hi> he further declared, that the <hi>Venetian</hi> State grew weaker and weaker by continual war, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before it was reduced to extremity, and they not being able to maintain war againſt ſo Potent an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, were to take a ſurer courſe for the preſervation of what yet of their Signory remained unto them, for that the ſafety of the <hi>Venetian</hi> State ſhould at all times be a ſure Fortreſs and Defence of the Chriſtian Commonweale, againſt all the furious attempts of the enemy, and uncertain events of time.</p>
               <p>This Peace though diſliked of other Chriſtian Princes, was advantagious to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for as much as the war had made their Trade to ceaſe, both in the <hi>Adriatick</hi> and <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Seas, which upon the concluſion of Peace with the <hi>Turks,</hi> returned again more then ever, by reaſon few other Chriſtian Merchants had the like liberty. This peace was the eaſier obtained of the <hi>Turk</hi> for as much as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had reduced the Kingdom of <hi>Tunis</hi> to his obedience, and that the <hi>Knights</hi> of <hi>Malta</hi> had an eye upon <hi>Tripo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> and other Sea port Towns holden by the <hi>Turks,</hi> upon the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> that he might be the more at leaſure to defend what he poſſeſſed, and if poſſible to recover that which his father had loſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Tunis;</hi> yet declining that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize for a time, he converted his Forces againſt <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Vayuod</hi> of <hi>Valachia,</hi> who a little before having driven <hi>Bogeanus</hi> out of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed himſelf of that Province, but upon his refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to pay <hi>Selymus</hi> double the Tribute he agreed for, he held him in ſuch diſtruſt, that he reſolved to take from him both his Principalities, and annex them to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, to prevent which if poſſible, the ſaid <hi>John</hi> raiſed a great power, calling to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> a warlike people of <hi>Polonia,</hi> who living

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57574:164"/>to give the Turks Battle, returned for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that in the firſt place he little doubted of the Faith of him whom he had found moſt faithful in the time of his greateſt diſtreſs, and uſed as a moſt truſty companion in all his Travels, and that it was no time now to ſtand in doubt or be afraid, and that as for himſelf, he would ere long come with the reſt of the Army, and take a view of the Enemies Camp, for that he was not come ſo far to fly but to fight in the defence of his Subjects and Country, and ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in four dayes after he joyned with the forerunners of his Army, and incamped near a Lake, which runneth out of <hi>Danubius,</hi> and with ſeveral of his truſty followers aſcended a high Hill, the better to take a veiw of the Enemies huge Camp, upon which plainly perceiving that he was betrayed by <hi>Czarnie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiche,</hi> who had then under his command 13000 of his choice Souldiers, he ſent for him, but he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Treaſon was diſcovered, ſent him word that he could not now come, the Enemy being ſo nigh at hand, but that he ſhould without delay ſee him in the Field as forward as the moſt couragious againſt the Enemy, but herein he failed his Lord; for Battle being joyned he cauſed his Enſigns to be let fall, and revolted to the Enemy, which ſo diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the reſt of the Souldiers that after a deſperate and bloody fight, finding themſelves oppreſs'd with multitudes, and their Countrey-men who ſhould have aſſiſted them, fighting againſt them, they gave back, which the <hi>Vayvod</hi> perceiving cauſed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to be ſounded, and with 20000 Foot men, and ſuch Horſemen as eſcaped the Battle, retired in as good order as the danger would permit, into the ruins of an old Town which a little before he had razed, and therein ſtrongly Fortified himſelf round about, which next day the Turks incamped, but
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57574:164"/>perceiving that it was not onely difficult but dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to aſſault him in his ſtrength, they ſent Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to him, to perſwade him to yield to Mercy and not expoſe his own Life, and the lives of ſo many of his Subjects to the fury of the inraged Souldiers, or miſeries they would be ſhortly reduced to by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, offering the Oaths of all the chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for his own ſecurity and the ſecurity of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to which propoſals he being perſwaded to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken he in conſideration that the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> might be permitted to return with their Horſes and Armes, into their own Countrey; that himſelf might be alive conveyed into the preſence of <hi>Selymus,</hi> there to make his defence, and that his Subjects might return to their reſpective homes, or take ſervice with the <hi>Turks;</hi> agreed to come out of his ſtrength and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf, to which his demands <hi>Capucius</hi> Baſſa General of the Turks Army conſented, and himſelf with the reſt of the great Commanders ſwore ſeven times (a uſual cuſtom amongſt the Turks for the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly obliging themſleves) to fulfil his requeſt.

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1575 <hi>Amurath</hi> eſtabliſhed many wholſom Laws, altered the Coin, and bountifully relieved the poor, and albeit he was of a mild and peaceable nature, yet that he might ſeem like to his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors

               <p>That which gave the Turks encouragement to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Territories of <hi>Polonia,</hi> was the diviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the nobility for <hi>Henry D' Valoys</hi> their King, upon notice that his brother <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth French King was dead, ſecretly departed to take upon him the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> to which he was rightful Heire, whereupon one party was for Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Maximilian</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Emperour, and the other ſtrongly oppoſing them would have introduced the great Duke of <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> Of which <hi>Amurath</hi> having notice, and ſuppoſing that to which ſoever of them it fell he would prove a troubleſome Neighbour, he ſent a Letter to diſſwade the Nobility and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelors of the Kingdom to chuſe neither, but to Elect a King amongſt themſelves, or elſe <hi>Stephen Buttor</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and in ſo doing they ſhould find him their conſtant Friend, or in refuſing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his deſire to expect all the calamities that attend on War. In this Letter the proud Turk ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf God of the Earth, Governour of the whole World, the Meſſenger of God, and faithful ſervant of the great Prophet.

                  <hi>Amurath</hi> upon the afore-mentioned conditions having drawn his Army out of <hi>Ruſcia,</hi> and taking advantage of the diſcord ariſing in the Kingdom of <hi>Perſia,</hi> upon the death of <hi>Tamas</hi> reſolved to bend his Forces to the Conqueſt of that great Kingdom, which (the diſſenſion amongſt the Sons of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed King about the ſucceſſion, made him ſuppoſe) was eaſie to be effected, whereupon raiſing ſuch great Forces as held <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> in ſuſpence, he yet declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed attempting any thing till he had knowledge what effects the civil broyls had wrought, which were that after a long contention, and the Murther of many of the Sons and Grandchildren of the deceaſed King, <hi>Mahomet</hi> Eldeſt ſon to <hi>Tamas,</hi> who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rejected the Diadem, to prevent the ruin of his Native Country, took upon him the Regency, though not without the envy of many of the great <hi>Sultans,</hi> whoſe guilt upon his being proclaimed King had cauſed them to fly, who like thorow paced Traitors in their exile ſolicited <hi>Amurath</hi> by all means ſpeedily to invade the Kingdom of <hi>Perſia,</hi> laying before him the facility of conquering that noble Kingdom, abounding with all manner of riches, and that the <hi>Georgians</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> evily affected towards the new King, would not fail upon the approach of his Army to joyn with him. Theſe and the like perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions fired the Turk with hopes of ſo glorious an atchievement, that notwithſtanding he was in League with the <hi>Perſian,</hi> yet after long debating the

And now <hi>Stephen</hi> the Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> having marryed Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> and being confirmed by the free choice of the Nobility King of <hi>Poland,</hi> he ſent his Ambaſſadors to <hi>Amurath,</hi> to conclude a firm and inviolable League, which was granted by the Turk very advantageous to the Chriſtians, that he might not be hindered in his <hi>Perſian</hi> War, which in <hi>Anno</hi> 1578. he undertook, ſending a great Army under the leading of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> Baſſa (who in the Reign of <hi>Selymus</hi> had Conquered <hi>Cyprus</hi>) into the Countrey of <hi>Servan,</hi> compoſed of theſe following Nations, <hi>viz,</hi> 12000 <hi>Meſopotamians,</hi> 14000 <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> 2000 <hi>Syrians,</hi> 10000 <hi>Natolians,</hi> 1000 Jews of <hi>Palaſtine,</hi> 4000 <hi>Cilicians,</hi> after which followed the Soldiers of <hi>Grecia,</hi> the Glory and Hope of the whole Camp to the number of 10000, as likewiſe 10000 <hi>Janizaries,</hi> Harquibu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, to whom 4000 of the Citizens of <hi>Er Zicſhum</hi> were added beſides many Voluntiers of divers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: inſomuch that the whole Army conſiſted of 110000 Horſe and Foot, beſides this multitude of men, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> brought into <hi>Perſia</hi> 500 pieces of Artillery, and 50 Waggon loads of Money to leavy other Soldiers, if occaſion required it.</p>

But <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> who with a great power of his choice ſouldiers, having waited a fit opportunity, peirced the Squadrons of the horſe, having firſt made a lane by the reiterated Vollies of his Artillery, and charged with ſuch fury, that although the <hi>Perſians</hi> incouraging each other did all than men were capable to perform, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overpowered with number, were at length bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and diſordered; they under the ſhelter of the night retired, which the <hi>Turks</hi> without much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty permitted, they not having any cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the Victory ſo gotten, their loſs was ſo great, yet keeping the field all that night, the next morning in token of his good ſucceſs, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> ſent

               <p>The next day after the battle <hi>Manuchlars,</hi> a Prince of the <hi>Georgians</hi> ſent a meſſenger to <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> to acquaint him that he was coming to confer with him, which did not a little rejoyce the Turk; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he cauſed all his Great Commanders with Trumpets, Enſigns diſplayed, Drums beating, and the diſcarge of all the Great Ordnance to receive him, and in like manner to conduct him to his Pavillion (not doubting but that the revolt of this Prince would greatly further his affairs) which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being done, and he entering the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> Tent, he there was cauſed to ſit down on his right hand, when after having made him preſents of ſuch chings as for that purpoſe he had brought, he gave the Baſſa to underſtand, That for the honour and eſtimation he conceived of the Turkiſh valour, he was ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the houſe of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> and as he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times deſired to venture his life and fortune in their ſervice, ſo at this preſent time he moved by his former deſire, allured by the ſtrange fame of his wonderful and victorious Army, and ſtirred up by a particular Fanta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe proceedings coming to the Ears of <hi>Amurath,</hi> and he from all hands certified that the ſtrength of the Chriſtians daily increaſed, he began to doubt his Empire in <hi>Europe,</hi> and therefore to defend the ſame raiſed a puiſſant Army <hi>anno</hi> 1594. at the head of which he reſolved to march in perſon, a thing he had not done ſince his taking upon him the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but on the 11th. of <hi>January,</hi> as the Army was upon its march, not far from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſuch a terrible Tempeſt of Hail, Rain, Snow, Wind, Thunder and Lightning aroſe, that by its impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity

The which the Tyrant taking as ominous to his proceedings, in great perplexity returned with his formidable Army to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where caſting himſelf upon his bed, after much tumbling and toſſing, falling aſleep he dreamed that he beheld a man of exceeding Stature, ſtanding with one his feet upon the Tower of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the other over the ſtraight fixed on the <hi>Aſian</hi> ſhoar, who ſtretching out his Arms held the Sun in one hand and the Moon in the other, at whom whilſt he was wondering the Monſter with his foot ſtruck the Tower, which forthwith fell down, and in its fall overthrew the great Temple with the Imperial Palace, whoſe Thundering awaking the Turk he much troubled with the ſtrangeneſs of the dream imediatly ſent for his Necromancers and Wizards to Interpret it, who to curry favour with their Prince hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally anſwered, That for as much as he had not with all his Forces, as with a Tempeſt impugned the Chriſtians, their great Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi> threatned by that dream to overturn the Tower, Temple, and Imperial Palace, which by a ſymbolical mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing denoted the Turkiſh Religion and Empire: which vain and fictitious Interpretation ſo moved the ſuperſtitious Tyrant, that having firſt asked pardon of his Impoſtor Prophet, he ſwore from henceforth to turn all his Forces upon the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and not to give over War till he had done his utmoſt to ſubdue them. Theſe vain threats did not in the leaſt diſmay the Chriſtian Princes, yet to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage a ſure Friend on their ſide, they cauſed publique prayers to be put up in all Churches, and that people might perceive on what ſlender and impious grounds the Tyrant, had reſolved the proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the War, had the vain Dream and the vainer

               <p>Whilſt theſe things were in doing the Emperour ſent his Embaſſadors to the great Duke of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> in all whoſe Courts their Negotiation proved ſucceſsful, nor in the mean time was the young Count <hi>Serinus</hi> idle, for that he with 300 Harquibuſires, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Troops of Horſe, and Companies to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 10000 took the Caſtles of <hi>Breſenza, Sigeſta</hi> and <hi>Baboſtcha,</hi> by the recovery of which ſtrong holds he opened a ſafe paſſage even to <hi>Ziget,</hi> the Baſſa of which ſtanding at that time in no ſmall doubt to be beſieged.

               <p>In the Upper part of <hi>Hungaria</hi> the Lord <hi>Tenf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenbeck,</hi> Commanding as the Arch-Dukes Lieutenant, with an Army of 2000 Horſe and Foot beſieged <hi>Hatvan,</hi> a ſtrong Town of the Turks, lying about ſix miles from <hi>Buda,</hi> Fortified with a Triple Ditch and Bullwarks of exceeding ſtrength, to the relief of which the Baſſa of <hi>Buda</hi> came with fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Souldiers, thinking at unawares to ſurprize the Chriſtian Camp but was fruſtrated in his project, for the Lord <hi>Tenffenbeck</hi> drawing off from before the City, paſſed through with much difficulty the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Sagijvay,</hi> when ſetting upon the Baſſa's Army after a hard fight he put it to the Rout, having the execution of the Turks for many miles, ſo that about Ten Thouſand of them were ſlain and taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, with a great Booty of Proviſion and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, after which the Chriſtians returned to the ſiege, yet finding the hazards and difficulty that they ſhould meet with in winning it, by the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Arch-Duke who with Forty Thouſand Men at the ſame time beſieged <hi>Strigonium,</hi> the Siege of <hi>Hatvan</hi> was given over, yet upon the raiſing thereof the Lord <hi>Tenffenbeck</hi> diſcomfited the Baſſa of <hi>Buda</hi> a ſecond time, as he was again coming to the relief thereof, in which conflict Five Thouſand Turks were ſlain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Strigonium</hi> after a long ſiege, and the burning of the old Town, being relieved by the coming of <hi>Sinan</hi> Baſſa with a great Army, the Arch-Duke thought it not yet convenient to let him take breath, but on the 28th. of <hi>June</hi> paſſed <hi>Danubius</hi> to expect the motion of <hi>Sinan</hi> Baſſa with his huge
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57574:187"/>Army, compoſed of Turks and <hi>Tartars,</hi> and by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent onſets daily weakned his Camp, nor were the <hi>Raſcians</hi> ſlow to revolt from the Turkiſh obedience. So that having raiſed a confuſed power, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Fifteen Thouſand they took many ſtrong Places, and obtained two notable Victories, one over the Baſſa of <hi>Temeſwar,</hi> in which himſelf and three of his <hi>Sanzacks,</hi> and about Nine Thouſand Five Hundred of his Turks were ſlain. And the other over another Baſſa that ſucceeded him, upon which they ſent to the Arch-Duke to receive them and their Countrey into the Emperours protection, and that in conſideration thereof they would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Ten Thouſand Men in the Field, whoſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals were by the Imperial General accepted.</p>
               <p>About this time the Emperour the better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the defence of his Provinces, called a Diet at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> where in the aſſembly of the <hi>German</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he declared how matters ſtood, and repeated the manifold injuries he had ſuſtained by the Turks, contrary to the League made with <hi>Amurath,</hi> and that amongſt the reſt he contrary to the Law of Nations had impriſoned <hi>Frederick Creckovitz</hi> his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador firſt at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and cauſed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of his followers to be thruſt into the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and afterwards to have ſent him with a few of his attendants to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> and thereto have kept him in priſon till he ended his dayes. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge which indignities thoſe daily offered, and ſuch as were like to enſue from the great Army at hand, he deſired the Princes to conſider a moſt ſpeedy way, and not by delay to indanger the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of <hi>Chriſtendoms</hi> falling into the hands of the mercyleſs Enemy. To which the Electoral Princes after a due conſideration, replyed, That they had

               <p>
                  <hi>Sinan</hi> Baſſa all this while not ignorant of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors proceedings, lay with an Army of One Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Fifty Thouſand Fighting men, between <hi>Buda</hi> and <hi>Alba Regalis,</hi> frequently ſending out Parties to waſt the Countries in poſſeſſion of the Emperour, yet with ſuch indifferent ſucceſs that he had no cauſe to boaſt, which made the Baſſa to raiſe his Camp, and in ſight of the Chriſtian Army which ſtill attended his motions, battered <hi>Dolis</hi> and St. <hi>Martins</hi> with ſuch fury that within a ſhort time they fell into his hands, the Imperialiſts at ſo great an odds not thinking it convenient to hazard a Battle to relief their beſieged Friends, and after doing other miſchief in their Territories layed ſiege to the City of <hi>Rab</hi> ſcituate on the Southſide of <hi>Danubius,</hi> where the River dividing it ſelf makes a moſt fertile Iſland called <hi>Schut,</hi> about twelve <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> miles from <hi>Vienna,</hi> in which Iſland lay the Chriſtian Camp. This City was defended by a Garriſon of Five Thouſand Men, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57574:188"/>of Count <hi>Hardeck</hi> a more valiant then at this time faithful Friend, for when every one ſuppoſed the City impregnable, and that the Turks for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes had without intermiſſion battered it with Sixty pieces of Cannon, and made ſeveral unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful aſſaults with the loſs of Fourteen Thouſand of their men the ſaid Count contrary to the minds of his Commanders and Souldiers capitulated with the Baſſa, and in conſideration of his departing with all his Treaſure, delivered that ſtrong piece in his hands. For which upon his arrival at <hi>Vienna,</hi> he by the judgement of Sixty of his Peers, had his Head and his right Hand ſtricken off, it being proved againſt him that he in leiw of the ſurrender had of the Baſſa received two bags of Ducats.</p>
               <p>During the ſiege of <hi>Rab</hi> the Chriſtians in the Iſland of <hi>Schut</hi> received a great loſs, for Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Turks and <hi>Tartars</hi> getting over in Boats or ſwimming upon their Horſes, came ſo ſuddainly upon their Camp, that having ſlain Two Thouſand of them and put the reſt into a great conſternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they entered their Trenches and carryed thence a booty valued at Five Hundred Thouſand Ducats, which loſs for a while after ſore weakned the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Nor were the Turks onely buſie in ſpoiling <hi>Hungary,</hi> but <hi>Italy</hi> alſo, for with a great Fleet under the leading of <hi>Ciala</hi> Baſſa <hi>Amuraths</hi> Admiral, they ſurprized <hi>Rhegium</hi> in <hi>Calabria,</hi> and utterly razed it, after which they ſpoiled all the Countrey about it, as likewiſe the Sea Coaſts of <hi>Italy</hi> in many other places, taking ſeveral Ships richly laden in the ſight of the Garriſon of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and carrying away a great number of poor people into miſerable Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.

                  <hi>Sinan</hi> Baſſa having by this time received new ſupplies and repaired <hi>Rab,</hi> putting therein a ſtrong Garriſon marched to <hi>Comara,</hi> before which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, but upon the approach of <hi>Matthias</hi> the Arch-Duke with a puiſſant Army of <hi>Germans, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians,</hi> and <hi>Hungarians</hi> to relieve it, he raiſed his ſiege not thinking it ſafe at that time to hazard a Battle, and by a Bridge of Boats Tranſported his Army over <hi>Danubius</hi> to <hi>Dolis,</hi> where he the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day diſmiſſed them, upon which the Arch-Duke without any hinderance coming to <hi>Comara,</hi> cauſed the breaches to be Repaired, and then leaving it to the protection of the Governour, <hi>viz.</hi> The Lord <hi>Bruun,</hi> who had faithfully defended it, he departed to take a view of the other Cities.</p>

               <p>Theſe proceedings of the Chriſtians rouſed <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> and inſpired him who was of a feirce and froward nature, to take revenge, in order to which he ſent for <hi>Sinan</hi> Baſſa out of <hi>Hungary,</hi> to confer with him about the management of the war, which once ſtated, he returned again to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> where upon his firſt Arrival, by what miſchance, yet ſuppoſed to be by the contrivance of the Janizaries, the cords of his Tent were cut, and it was let fall about his ears; now at his coming, ſo great was the dearth in all the parts of <hi>Hungary,</hi> where the Turks had their
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57574:191"/>poſſeſſions, that ſeveral <hi>Tartarian</hi> women following the Camp, killed their own children, and ate them, which ſamine ingendered ſuch a Peſtilence, that the Turks and Tartars dyed in abundance, inſomuch that of eighty thouſand of the latter, which the year before came at divers times to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Turks,</hi> not above eight thouſand remained alive. And now the Chriſtian Army haſtened from all parts to the Imperial ſtandard; ſo that of <hi>Germans, Saxons, Bohemians, Hungarians, Spaniards, Italians, Romans, Flemings, Franks</hi> and <hi>Sweeds,</hi> in a ſhort time there were found fifteen thouſand nine hundred horſe, and fifty thouſand foot, under the conduct of moſt reſolute Commanders, of which <hi>Matthias</hi> the Arch Duke was General, and Count <hi>Mansfelt</hi> ſent by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> with 2000 horſe, and 6000 foot, was appointed by the Emperor his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The greateſt part of the aid, promiſed by the Chriſtian Princes, for the maintenance of the war, being come to <hi>Vienna,</hi> Count <hi>Mansfelt</hi> called a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the chief Commanders, to conſult whether they ſhould lay ſiege to ſome place of Importance, or march to give the enemy battle, whom he ſaid

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57574:193"/>to relieve it with twenty thouſand Turks, reſolving to fight his way into it; whereupon divers parties were ſent out to skirmiſh, and by retiring to draw the enemy into the danger of the Chriſtian Army, which project was not unſucceſſeful, for the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Baſſa coming on between the hills of St. <hi>George</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas</hi> near to the Suburbs called the <hi>Ruſcian</hi> City, put his Army in order of Battle, as did the Chriſtians, when in the mean while the <hi>Lord Paifi</hi> with his <hi>Hungarian</hi> horſemen fetching a compaſs about the hill, on the one ſide and the Lord <hi>Swartzenburg</hi> with ſuch horſe as he had under his command, on the other ſide, ſo incloſed the Turks rear, that they could not without great danger retire, when as both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were orderly ranged, the ſignal of battle was given, the Turks without any great harm to the Chriſtians diſcharged ſeventeen Pieces of Artillery, after which, with ſhowers of Arrows and the ſmoak of the Harquibuſes the Sky was darkned, and in a trice, not without great ſlaughter, the battle was brought to the ſword, at what time Victory decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the Chriſtians, the Turks being every where moſt miſerably beaten down, crying out for mercy, and flying as they found opportunity, and in the end the Baſſa himſelf from his ſtand, perceiving his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the rout, and that the day was irrecoverably loſt, fled for his life, and about midnight recovered <hi>Buda,</hi> with not above twenty of his followers, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that City with the laments of ſuch as had in the battle loſt their friend. The ſlain and thoſe taken priſoners were fourteen thouſand, and the ſpoil of the Camp conſiſting of rich Pavilions, Money, Plate, Ammunition, fair horſes, proviſion, Camels, and the like, was valued at 300000 Ducates, part of which was ſent to the Emperour, part to the Arch Duke, and

               <p>The Turkiſh Army thus overthrown, the Chriſtians returned again to the ſiege, when as the Count ſent to Summon <hi>Alis Beg</hi> the Governour to ſurrender the City, and that in conſideration thereof, he and all that were with him ſhould be ſuffered to depart, but the meſſengers finding the froward old man obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, notwithſtanding the great dearth that was then in the City, he returned without effecting any thing; upon which a terrible battery being placed againſt the lower City, it thundred againſt the walls and Bullwarks ſo long, that laying open a fair breach, the Souldiers entred with ſuch fury, that bearing down all before them, they upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Marqueſs of <hi>Burgave</hi> with freſh Troops, they poſſeſſed themſelves of it, driving the Turks into the Caſtle and upper City, with great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſparing in their rage none that came in their way, yet the malitious Turks e'r their departure, to deprive the Chriſtians of the benefit they might reap by the ſpoil, had by Trains laid for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, fired the building in ſeveral places, ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the wind, the flame could be hardly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, till it had laid moſt of the goodly building waſte, yet was this great Victory accompanied with ſorrow for the death of the Count <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> who by drinking cold Liquors, after his great pains ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the late battle, fell into a feaver, which turning to the bloody Flix, deprived him of his life, to the great grief of the Chriſtian Princes, who on his Courage and Conduct, had repoſed next to God the ſucceſs of their Arms, yet the Chriſtians conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the ſiege, nor was it long e'r the beſieged loſt <hi>Alis Beg</hi> their Governour, who walking upon the wall to give directions in places of moſt danger, had

               </p>
               <p>During this good ſucceſs of the Imperialiſts the Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> was not idle, but with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of his beſt Souldiers, ſetting upon thirty thouſand Turks (who as unbidden Gueſts were coming to his wedding, which he was then ſolemnizing with <hi>Maria Christina,</hi> daughter to <hi>Charles</hi> the late Arch Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi>) he gave ſuch a welcome, that few of them returned to tell the news, after which, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting his victory he took <hi>Lippa,</hi> a ſtrong Town, with divers other Towns and Caſtles of the Turks, out of which they had for a long time annoyed the Countries round about them; about the ſame time the Lords <hi>Herbenſtien, Lucowitz</hi> and <hi>Eckenburg</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered with the Baſſa of <hi>Boſna,</hi> as he was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ten thouſand Turks and <hi>Tartars,</hi> from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Babotzka,</hi> whom after a hard fight they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw, putting moſt of them to the ſword, the Baſſa himſelf, upon a ſwift horſe hardly eſcaping.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſucceſſefull proceedings of the Chriſtians ſo inraged the <hi>Turk,</hi> that imputing ſeveral of the diſgraces that had happened to the neglect of <hi>Ferat Baſſa,</hi> he by the advice of <hi>Sinan Baſſa,</hi> ſent for him, who truſting to his innocency, boldly came to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to what ſhould be objected againſt him, though warned to the contrary, but he was ſcarce arrived e'r by the command of <hi>Mahomet</hi> he was ſtrangled and his goods to the value of five hundred thouſand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats confiſcated.</p>
               <p>After the death of <hi>Ferat,</hi> who was ſomewhat a favourer of the Chriſtians, <hi>Sinan</hi> the proud Baſſa,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57574:195"/>ſon to a Fiſherman, and their mortal enemy, was ſent with a great Army into <hi>Valachia,</hi> to reduce that and the other revolted Countries to the Turkiſh obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but being encountred by the <hi>Tranſilvanian</hi> Forces, his Army was overthrown with great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and himſelf in his flight falling into a Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, hardly eſcaped with life; after which he fled to <hi>Canſtantinople,</hi> to plead his own cauſe, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed upon his undertaking that Expedition at the price of his head, to reduce <hi>Valachia, Moldavia,</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> to their former obedience.</p>
               <p>Not long after the overthrow of <hi>Sinan,</hi> the Lords <hi>Eckenberg</hi> and <hi>Leucowitz</hi> overthrew twenty thouſand who under the leading of the Baſſa of <hi>Boſna,</hi> inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the country of <hi>Crotia,</hi> and following their Victory, entred the Turkiſh Dominions and burnt 15 Villages, carrying away a great booty, and ſoon after took <hi>Petrina,</hi> which after a cloſe ſiege, and ſome furious aſſaults was abandoned by the Turks. In the mean while <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the <hi>Tranſylvanian</hi> Prince, raiſed a greater power than before, upon notice that <hi>Sinan</hi> Baſſa was again upon his march to invade his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; at what time the <hi>Ziculi</hi> or <hi>Sciculy,</hi> a people bordering on the North of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> ſent to him to offer him their ſervice, as weary of the Turkiſh thraldom; who according to agreement, beſides many rich preſents, and ſtore of proviſion, ſent him forty thouſand men well appointed, which no ſooner joyned him, he had notice that <hi>Sinan</hi> had paſſed <hi>Danubius,</hi> by a bridg of Boats; whereupon he marched with all dilligence to meet him, and in another ſet battle, gave him a fatal overthrow, in which there were thirty thouſand ſlain and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoners, beſides a rich booty; nor did the River <hi>Danubius</hi> upon their haſty repaſſing the bridge,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57574:195"/>which was near two miles over, devour a leſs num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, inſomuch that <hi>Sinan</hi> ſwore in a great rage, that the young Prince had in a ſhort time Eclipſed all the renown he in the courſe of his whole life had got.</p>
               <p>After this overthrow of the Turks, which they number amongſt their great miſchances, the Caſtle and Iſland in the River with little loſs were recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then in great Triumph laden with the <hi>Turks</hi> ſpoils the Prince returned to <hi>Alba Julia,</hi> at what time by his Captains he took the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Jenna,</hi> and intercepted about 70 waggons richly laden, which they of <hi>Temeſwar</hi> fearing to be beſieged were ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, together with their wives and children, to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of greater ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Theſe things perplexing the proud Turk, he ſent his ſpecial Meſſengers to ſtir up the <hi>Crimeſian Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> (a people living for the moſt part on ſpoil) to invade <hi>Moldavia, Tranſylvania,</hi> and <hi>Valachia,</hi> who were likewiſe incouraged thereto by the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>Polonia,</hi> he ſo far inſinuating with the King, that <hi>Moldavia</hi> was taken from the <hi>Tranſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Prince, and a new <hi>Vayvod</hi> placed therein, who opened (contrary to his faith given) three wayes for the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> to invade <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> of which perfidious dealing Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth by his Letters to the King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> grievouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained; and likewiſe againſt Cardinal <hi>Zamoskie,</hi> the Chancelor, and firſt mover of this miſchief, whom he cited to appear before him at <hi>Rome,</hi> there to anſwer to what ſhould by the Ambaſſadours of the Chriſtian Princes, be objected againſt him, charging them both with breach of faith, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty to the King of Heaven, by betraying the Chriſtians into the hand of the ſworn enemies of the Chriſtian Religion, yet both the King and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57574:196"/>uſed ſuch endeavours that they ſatisfied the Pope in the neceſſity of their writing better to him to that purpoſe, when at the ſame time <hi>Cham Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zikieri</hi> the <hi>Tartarian</hi> King wrote to <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> to put him in mind of his promiſe to give his Army free paſſage, as likewiſe to deſtroy the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> who as he ſaid by daily incurſions waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Frontier, and to make a perpetual League with him yet onely the former requeſt was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtians not pleaſed with the proceedings of the <hi>Polonian,</hi> to ſhew how little they eſteemed his Friendſhip, inraged as it were with his revolt burnt and deſtroyed all the Turkiſh Garriſons up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his Frontiers, whom he durſt not protect for fear of having his own Dominions waſted in the like manner, but what happened this year 1596 advantagious to the Chriſtians was the death of <hi>Sinan</hi> Baſſa their ſworn Enemy, who having by his Friends and many rich preſents eſcaped the fury of the angry <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> who had vowed his death, ſoon after through grief and ſhame of his late over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw died, after he had for Fifty years waſted the Earth with Fire and Sword, Yet the following Spring <hi>Mahomet</hi> with a great power purpoſed in perſon to paſs into <hi>Hungary,</hi> but by reaſon of the Plague and Famine, that raged throughout his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire he could not accompliſh his deſign, but was more and more perplexed by the revolt of the <hi>Georgians,</hi> and the great Army the new King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> was raiſing for the recovery of <hi>Tauris,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to prevent the worſt the <hi>Tranſilvanian</hi> Prince in perſon went to the Courts of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Pope to crave Aid, where he was with great kindneſs received, and promiſed ſuch ſupplies of Men and Mony as his occaſion ſhould require, but

All this time the Lord <hi>Palfi</hi> with the Garriſon Souldiers of <hi>Strigonium</hi> was not idle, but uſed his utmoſt dilligence to ſurprize the Turks Convoys and Garriſons, nor was his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation fruſtrated, for overrunning the Country as far as the Walls of <hi>Temeſwar</hi> he got many rich booties, and removed ſuch Chriſtians as were in danger of the Turks Garriſon nearer his own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing but narrowly of the Baſſa of <hi>Temeſwar</hi> with all his Treaſure, as he was going to <hi>Belgrade</hi> to give place to a new Baſſa, but however he fell into the hands of the <hi>Hungarian Heidons,</hi> who overthrew his Convoy, ſlew him, and took all his riches laden in Seventy Five Waggons to the value of Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand <hi>Hungarian</hi> Ducats, which ſo inraged the Turks that gathering Forty Thouſand ſtrong they beſieged <hi>Lippa,</hi> but after the loſs of ſix Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of their number in many furious aſſaults, they left their Trenches and in great confuſion retired, which flight was occaſioned by the Governour of <hi>Lugaz</hi> his ſurpriſing the Suburbs of <hi>Temeſwar,</hi> and ſetting them on fire, which being ſeen in the Turks Camp cauſed amongſt them that great conſternation, as thinking the Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> with his whole Army was coming on, and even at their backs.

               <p>Theſe continual currants of Victory carryed the <hi>Tranſilvanian</hi> Prince to the Siege of <hi>Tameſwar,</hi> which he for many dayes furiouſly battered, but upon notice that the Baſſa of <hi>Natolia</hi> the forerunner of <hi>Mahomets</hi> Army, was come to <hi>Belgrade</hi> with Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand Turks, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> with an Army of One Hundred and Fifty Thouſand was coming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him to the Relief of the City, and he not having yet received the ſupplies promiſed by the Chriſtian Princes his Confederates, thought good to raiſe his ſiege and depart for <hi>Lippa,</hi> where having left a ſtrong Garriſon he kept on his way to <hi>Alba-Julia,</hi> and aſſembled there the States of his Principality to conſider the moſt expedient means for raiſing more Forces to repreſs ſo potent an Adverſary.</p>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57574:203"/>that now it again began as if revived from its Embers to break out into a flame, and in a trice ſwept away ſeveral Towns, whereupon <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſent to the <hi>Perſian</hi> to demand for the more aſſurance of the League one of his Sons as Hoſtage, which was ſo evilly taken that the Sophy commanded the Turks Ambaſſador to be ſlain, and although that rigorous ſentence was remitted, yet by the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Sophy he was baſtinadoed, and in deſpite of him that ſent him returned with great diſgrace, the which though it highly offended <hi>Mahomet,</hi> yet he finding himſelf at that time not in a condition to revenge it, only bluſtered a little and to prevent the worſt, put ſtrong Garriſons into his Frontire Towns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1601, The Chriſtian Confederates brought a ſtrong Army into the Field, for fear of which the Turkiſh General propoſed many ofters of Peace, but ere any was concluded, the ſaid General <hi>Ibraim</hi> Baſſa died, when as the Chriſtians not to omit any opportunity took divers ſtrong places, and amongſt the reſt after a terrible battery, and the loſs of Eight Thouſand men <hi>Alba Regalis,</hi> one of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and ſtrongeſt Cities of <hi>Hungary,</hi> into which the furious Souldiers entering through Streets of fire and over heaps of the ſlain, put all they met to the Sword, few or none except the Baſſa being taken to mercy, inriched themſelves with a great ſpoil, eſpecially the Walloons, who ſpared not to rifle the Tombs of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Kings, which barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the Turks themſelves had abſtained from. Yet hardly was the ſpoil taken but news came that <hi>Aſſan</hi> Baſſa made General in the ſtead of <hi>Ibraim,</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a great Army to relieve it, whereupon Duke <hi>Mercury</hi> drew out his Forces and in a mortal Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſlew the Baſſa, and moſt of his men, taking his

               <p>The Chriſtians hightened with this ſucceſs, were now reſolved to attempt the recovery of <hi>Caniſia</hi> from before which (after they had a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged it, and layed open with their furious battery ſeveral breaches, killing in the ſeveral aſſaults a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Turks) they were by the unſeaſonableneſs of the weather obliged to depart, to the great grief of the Commanders, though joy of the Souldiers, who through the exceſſive Cold that then happened were become unſerviceable, many of them being frozen to Death in the Trenches.

To which they replyed, That they were willing to obey the Emperour in all things, but that their people in continual Wars being wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, they deſired him to conſider how little able they were to keep an Army in the Field, without which the Countrey could not be defended; but if the Emperour would protect them, and ſecure them with a ſtanding Army, they would yearly pay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the defraying of the charges Fifteen Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Hungarian</hi> Ducats, and furniſh them with all things neceſſary. It being a thing more Honourable and Profitable for a Prince moderately to uſe his Subjects, then for covetouſneſs to devour them in one day, and in their loſs to loſe himſelf for ever. This their offer was by <hi>Baſta</hi> accepted, and the minds of the people by many perſwaſive arguments kept in their dutiful Allegiance to the Emperour. But whilſt peace was expected on all ſides <hi>Moyſes</hi> the Rebel, with a great power of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> entered <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> at ſuch time as <hi>Baſta</hi> was abſent dreaming of no ſuch matter, and ſeizing upon <hi>Wiſceborongh,</hi> ſome other places of ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, his name began to ſpread wide.

Yet at length meeting with them before he was aware, fell into their danger, not expecting them to be above half the number, he found them ſo that he not exceeding Nine Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and the Rebels not leſs then Thirty Thouſand, when he had done all that became a valiant Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er retired in good order, leaving his Baggage, Tents, and Artilery with the dead Bodies of One Thouſand of his men as prey to the Conquerours; but they more greedy of the ſpoil then to purſue him, fell to plundering the Tents with ſuch eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he thereof advertized, and turning his recollected Forces ſuddainly upon them, who dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of nothing leſs entered amongſt them unarmed as they were, every one with his hands full of ſpoiles, made ſuch a ſlaughter that ſcarcely a third part of them eſcaped, ſo that by their careleſsneſs within leſs then four hours, the vanquiſhers were vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and amongſt the ſlain fell <hi>Moyſes</hi> himſelf, whoſe head was after fixed upon a Launce and ſet up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Walls of <hi>Carolſtadt.</hi>

Yet the Turks leſſened his victory, and the more to amuſe the Chriſtians ſpread a falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that near unto <hi>Babylon</hi> his Army was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and himſelf taken Priſoner, not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to magnifie the Forces of their Emperour, who indeed for his years was very active in the affairs of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57574:212"/>Government though cruel withal towards his own Subjects, and farther they gave it out that at once he intended to invade with puiſſant Armies, both <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Perſia;</hi> purpoſing to annex them to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire: but theſe great words (though in truth the Chriſtians were more negligent in their preparations then the occaſion required) proved but Air.</p>

               <p>The ſeveral Hoſtilities having baniſhed all hopes of Peace, ſeveral skirmiſhes paſſed between the Chriſtians and Turks, in which the latter were for the moſt part put to the worſt, and had been more diſtreſſed had not the Imperial Souldiers mutined, and for want of pay ſpoiled the Countrey of <hi>Auſtria</hi> even within the ſight of <hi>Vienna,</hi> the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of which City they had ſacked, had not the Governour come againſt them with a great power, and forced them to lay down their Arms, cauſing the Ring-leaders to be puniſhed with death and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57574:213"/>his firſt undertaking being to ſurprize <hi>Lippa,</hi> but therein found ſuch bad ſucceſs, that he hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his own Garriſon, leaving moſt of his men dead behind him, and ſoon after a terrible fire hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening in <hi>Caniſia</hi> layed it almoſt waſt, firing the Magazine of Powder and blowing up the Cittadel, Towers, Houſes, and Wall, ſo that had any forces of the Chriſtians been near in that General conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they might eaſily have ſurprized it, after which loſt the Turks ſuſtained another for Two Hundred of the Garriſon of <hi>Buda,</hi> going abroad to forrage, were by the ſallying of the Garriſon of <hi>Peſth</hi> all cut off.</p>

The troubles in <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Tranſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> more and more increaſed, the former being occaſioned by the Biſhops (in their late aſſembly) paſſing a decree that all of the reformed Religion ſhould be burnt, or baniſhed, againſt which wicked Decree, though the Nobility of the Kingdom openly proteſted againſt, yet were their Churches ſeized, and Publick and Private worſhip forbidden, as alſo the reading of the Bible; to redreſs which griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, <hi>Baſta</hi> promiſed redreſs, but <hi>Botscay</hi> having made them a ſtirrup to help him into the ſaddle would hearken to no peace, unleſs <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> might be delivered to him, and that the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Hungary</hi> might be a <hi>Hungarian</hi> born, and that all offices might be beſtowed upon <hi>Hungarians,</hi> and the Souldiers of other Nations withdraw ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch as were in Garriſon, and thoſe not to paſs their appointed limits; and laſtly, that <hi>Hungarian</hi> Souldiers ſhould receive the Emperors pay, and that when ever an Aſſembly of the Eſtates was held at <hi>Presburg,</hi> the Emperor himſelf ſhould be there in perſon.

               <p>Theſe inteſtine troubles gave the Turks opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to poſſeſs themſelves of the Cities of <hi>Vacia</hi> and <hi>Vicegrade,</hi> and committed great outrages in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, and what was more to the diſadvantage of the Emperor, the <hi>Haducks</hi> his chief ſtrength fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the Rebels, revolted from him, which <hi>Baſta</hi> perceiving, and finding his Forces daily to decreaſe, procured of the Emperor a General pardon for all offences paſt, as well Temporal as Eccleſiaſtical, promiſing upon their ſubmiſſion to reſtore them to their Liberties, priviledges, and Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as formerly exerciſed, and that no man ſhould be moleſted, by vertue of any Decree made by the Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this pardon was proclaimed with the beat of Drum and ſound of Trumpet in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon which ſome of the Nobility, whoſe Eſtates lay in danger to be ſpoiled by the Souldiers, came in and ſubmitted themſelves, yet the Rebels Army was no whit leſſened, but rather increaſed, inſomuch that the <hi>Haducks</hi> drawing themſelves apart beſieged <hi>Sacinar,</hi> in which was an Imperial Garriſon, and after divers aſſaults took it, and marching from thence indeavoured to have ſurpriſed the ſtrong Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Tocay,</hi> but their deſign was fruſtrated by the ſtout reſiſtance of thoſe in Garriſon; but that which had like to have proved worſt of all to <hi>Basta</hi> was the mutiny of his own Souldiers, which he hardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed with a great ſum of mony.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Haducks</hi> ſtill roaming about as men greedy of prey, lay ſiege to <hi>Fileck,</hi> which after ſome loſs they took, and placed a ſtrong Garriſon therein; upon which Ambaſſadors were ſent to <hi>Boſcay</hi> the head of the Rebels, to treat with him in the Emperors name, about a peace, but without receiving any ſatisfaction,

So that thereby all hopes of Peace would vaniſh, which did not a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Turks, whoſe Trade was greatly impaired by the roving <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> which the Emperor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and reſolving not to delay his journey, (or indeed his deſign to cut off the whole order of the Janizaries, for the inſolencies frequently offered him, by thoſe Maſterful ſlaves) he ſent to haſten <hi>Sba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raskie,</hi> upon whoſe arrival a peace was concluded, though much to the prejudice of his Territories in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and now that obſtacle being removed, he ſent his Carriages over into <hi>Aſia,</hi> with all his Treaſure, not ſparing the Plate and Ornaments of his Pallace, which made the Janizaries miſtruſt ſome deſign more then ordinary, whereupon they reſolved to ſtop his proceedings, and therefore the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he intended to depart, they with great clamour run to the Seraglio, though unarmed, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Delavir</hi> the <hi>Vizier Baſſa, Hoja</hi> the Emperors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, the <hi>Caſlariago</hi> Governour of the women, the <hi>Deflardar</hi> or Treaſurer, the <hi>Cadelescher</hi> or chief Judg, with ſome other prime officers, whom they ſaid had Counſelled their Emperor to undertake this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Voyage, for which they reſolved to puniſh them with death, charging the Emperor ſtrictly that he ſhould neither go to <hi>Mecca,</hi> nor paſs over into <hi>Aſia.</hi>

               <p>To calm this Tempeſt the Emperor came forth in perſon, and uſed many arguments to perſwade them to their duty and Allegiance, promiſing he ſhould lay aſide his purpoſe, but now nothing would ſerve theſe miſcreants, but they muſt have the aforeſaid Officers delivered to them, To which the Emperor replyed,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57574:236"/>that his honour would greatly ſuffer if he ſhould permit his friends to be torn from him, but if they had offended in ought, and it was proved againſt them, in the Divano, whether they ſhould be brought to anſwer any accuſation that ſhould be objected againſt them, they ſhould be puniſhed by Law, but this did not pacifie them, for they clamoured yet louder, ſaying they knew them guilty, and that ſhould be ſufficient; whereupon they run to the houſe of the <hi>Hoja,</hi> and not finding him there, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, and from thence paſſing to the Grand Vizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers houſe, they thought to have done the like there, but finding it fortifyed, they ſet Guards in ſeveral parts of the City all night, and the next morning came before the Pallace with their Arms, making their demands as before; whereupon the <hi>Hoſa Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deleschar</hi> and <hi>Tefterdar</hi> fled, and were not for a time found, as likewiſe did the Grand Vizier, with the conſent of the Emperor, who promiſed himſelf to weather this ſtorm, though in the end he proved too weak, yet was the Vizier brought back by a Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, a reputed Saint, after he was got into <hi>Aſia,</hi> who truſting to his innocence, reſolved to face the Tempeſt, but the rude multitude without reſpect to his Reverend Age, and great Merits, having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten him into their power, cut him to pieces in the ſight of the Emperor, which he perceiving would, though too late, have fled over into <hi>Aſia,</hi> for now all means were cut off, for the Janizaries had ſtopped the Port, and in a great rage demanded <hi>Muſtapha</hi> the Emperors uncle, who was kept a priſoner in the Seraglio, and the firſt day of the Tumult by the Emperors command, put into a ſecret vault, with two <hi>Negro</hi> women, where after much ſearch, and the racking of ſeveral ſervants to make them diſcover him, he was found and born in Triumph through
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57574:237"/>the ſtreets, to the old <hi>Seraglio,</hi> having not yet been able to lay hands on <hi>Oſman,</hi> by reaſon he kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within his ſtrengths, but hearing they intended to proclaim his uncle Emperor, he at the perſwaſion of the <hi>Mufti,</hi> putting himſelf in mourning, went with a few of his followers, and amongſt them the <hi>Aga</hi> of the Janizaries, to the old Seraglio, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf to the inraged Souldiers with tears, beſeeching them to return to their former obedience, and Loyalty, offering to make them any ſatisfaction, repenting him of his error, and finally invoked them by the merits of his Father and all his Anee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, to have ſome pitty upon him their true maſter, This ſubmiſſion a little calmed their fierce natures, ſo that they began to relent, and had again acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged their Lord, had not the <hi>Aga,</hi> ſuppoſing to Curry favour with the Emperor, ſharply reproved them of ingratitude and diſloyalty, which again raiſed the not extinguiſhed fire, into ſuch a flame, that it was no more to be ſubdued; but firſt having ſlain the <hi>Aga,</hi> and <hi>Huzein Baſſa,</hi> with ſeveral of the Emperors followers of leſſer note, they ſeized on his perſon, and carryed him before <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding ſentence againſt him, when as the forſaken Prince, pleading for his life (and the new Emperor, not knowing how to condemn, only nodding in token that they might do what they pleaſed) They after a conſult amongſt themſelves, determined only to impriſon him whereupon they ſet him on horſe-back, an inſolent <hi>Spahy</hi> changing Turbants with him, and carryed him to the ſeven Towers, denying by the way a draught of water, and then returning placed <hi>Muſtapha</hi> in the Throne proclaiming him Emperor, and went to Sack the Houſes of thoſe they had murthered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muſtapha</hi> having once again mounted the Throne
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57574:237"/>and of a miſerable Captive made the ſecond time Emperor, was perſwaded by <hi>Darut Baſſa,</hi> a villaine raiſed to that dignity by the new Emperor, that if <hi>Oſman</hi> lived he would ſit uneaſie in his throne, and that the Janizaries cooling on the matter, would again advance him the rightful Heir of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, whereupon it was concluded he ſhould be made away, the charge of which was committed to this wicked Counſellor, who knowing his dignity would expire with <hi>Muſtaphas,</hi> ſtrangled young <hi>Oſman</hi> in priſon, after he had reigned three years and ſome odd dayes, not exceeding ſixteen years of Age, and ſo an end was put to the deſign he had to ſubdue the <hi>German</hi> Empire, and afterwards all <hi>Europe,</hi> with ſuch ſucceſs he flattered himſelf, little remembring that when man propoſes, God diſpoſes.</p>
               <p>One thing is worthy of note, a little before this Tumult happened, <hi>Oſman</hi> dreamed that he rid a Camel, and being mounted he could not force him to go by fair means nor ſtripes, and that then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending in a rage to revenge it with his ſword, the body of the beaſt vaniſhed, leaving in his hand on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the head and bridle, at which dream being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly troubled, he the next day ſends for one of his Wizards to interpret it, but he refuſed, perſwading him to apply himſelf to the <hi>Mufty,</hi> which he did, and had this Interpretation, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Camel ſignified his Empire, his Riding his abuſe in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his deſcenſion or alighting, his depoſing, the vaniſhing of the body of the Beaſt, the revolt of his Subjects, the head and bridle remaining in his hand on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a bare Title, and that he ſhould ſhortly dye and loſe his Empire, the empty name only of Emperor accompanying him to his grave.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57574:238"/>them, but the children crying out, ſeveral of the Pages run to their reſcue, and falling upon the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of death, ſlew the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> and evilly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the others that attended him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſent word to the Janizaries and Spahis, who approved of their proceedings, commanding the body of the <hi>Aga</hi> to be hanged up in the <hi>Hippodrome,</hi> as a terrour to thoſe that ſhould attempt the like for the future, and in a rage went to the Pallace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Juſtice on them that had Councilled ſo wicked a purpoſe, but the new Emperor, who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered not much from an ideot, ſolemnly proteſted he was altogether ignorant of the matter, and if ſuch command were procured, it was gotten by ſabreption, which Proteſtation was eaſily believed, yet <hi>Darut</hi> Baſſa, and the Emperors mother were vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menly ſuſpected, when to appeaſe the angry ſouldiers, the Baſſa was diſplaced from the Vizierſhip, <hi>Hazein Baſſa</hi> placed in his ſtead, and the Emperors mother hid in the Pallace till the Tempeſt was over, which could be no otherwiſe allayed then by a ſhowr of Gold Chequins.</p>
               <p>After which, the new Vizier proteſting either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the affairs of the Empire, or fall a Sacrifice, did a little reſtore the face of Juſtice, by making exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſome, and terrifying others with threats, inſomuch that he was looked upon as a man fit for thoſe boiſterous times, nor was that his only aim, but he reſolved when once ſettled in his place, to remove <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and place <hi>Morat</hi> brother to <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in the Imperial ſeat, not thinking himſelf ſafe, under a man that was altogether governed by an imperious woman, deſirous of Rule, and was no further capable of the paſſions of love and hate then they were infuſed into him.</p>
               <p>During theſe troubles of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57574:239"/>Duke <hi>Sbaraskie</hi> lay upon the Frontiers, and would not advance to ratifie the peace between the King his maſter and the new <hi>Sultan,</hi> till ſuch time as Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Rowe</hi> his Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittains</hi> Ambaſſador, then reſident at the Port had given him his faith for his ſecurity, which done, the Duke advanced, and upon his arrival at the Port, was magnificently entertained by the new Vizier, yet e'r any thing was abſolutely concluded, a matter happened which had like to have turned all into nothing; for on the 17 of <hi>June</hi> 1622 Prince <hi>Coreskie,</hi> who had been taken in the late war between <hi>Oſman</hi> and <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> was ſtrangled in priſon at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> which put all into murmur and deep conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, to what intent it was done, when ſo great a ranſom might have been had for his releaſe, but moſt believed it was done out of a Politick end, for that the Prince being a mortal enemy to the Turks, if he ſhould have been ſet at liberty, his reſtleſs nature would not have ſuffered the peace to have continued long inviolable, yet the urgent affairs of <hi>Poland</hi> ſo requiring, the Peace was concluded in nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Articles, much to the advantage of the <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> King, the Turks greatly fearing at that jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, the Chriſtians uniting againſt them, might diſmember their Empire.</p>
               <p>The new Vizier by this time having won the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Souldiers, reſolved upon his former purpoſe of Depoſing <hi>Muſtapba,</hi> and ſetting up <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> Brother to <hi>Oſman,</hi> then a child, and the better to forward his purpoſe, he cauſed the <hi>Aga</hi> of the Janizaries, and ſeveral Officers of the Court to be ſeized, as contrivers of the death of <hi>Coreskie,</hi> whom himſelf had commanded to be ſtrangled, which raiſed another Tumult; for the Janizaries running furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to the Court, demanded their Captain, whom
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57574:239"/>the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had ordered to be put to death, and had done great miſchief had he not been delivered, nor were they ſo contented, but peremptorily demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the head of the Viſier, ſolemnly proteſting to facrifice him for the affront done to their order; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which eſcaping through the Emperors Garden, he took boat and paſſed over into <hi>Aſia,</hi> whereupon they ſacked his houſe, and found therein great ſtore of Treaſure, they likewiſe demanded the heads of ſeveral others, but in the end all was huſhed, yet they proceeded to the Election of a new Viſier, making choice of one <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> a man of a ſoft nature and eaſily ruled, who ſcarcely durſt do Juſtice for fear of offending any man, which proceeding of the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Janizaries nevertheleſs, cauſed the wiſer ſort of men to retire from office and imployment, and to the inſufficient daily change and ruine; for the Emperor durſt not move but by the directions of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers whoſe creature he was, ſo many inſolencies were frequently committed, and all <hi>Aſia</hi> greatly endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered to be loſt, for at <hi>Bagdat</hi> antiently <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Captain of the Janizaries killed the Baſſa, burnt the <hi>Mufti,</hi> and gave his daughter in Marriage to one <hi>Aſſan Beg,</hi> pretender to an Antient Inheritance of a bordering Province, to cantonize that part nor <hi>Aſia</hi> only ſtood in ſuſpence what to do, but the Dominions of the Turkiſh <hi>Sultan</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> greatly wavered, as doubting whom to obey.</p>
               <p>On the 22 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> an Extraordinary Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor from <hi>Bethlehem Gabor</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Port, who amongſt other inſtructions had order to excuſe his maſter, and to declare the reaſons, why he had made peace with the Emperor, without the knowledge of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> which were, that the war had continued three years in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Hungary</hi> and had ſo waſted the Country, that
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57574:240"/>it was impoſſible for him to ſtay longer in the field unleſs he would have expoſed his Army to thoſe wants, that would have reduced him to have accepted of an inglorious peace, or to have ſuffered a great part of his Souldiers to periſh for want, and that if he had ſtood out upon the peace concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sultan and the <hi>Polonian,</hi> the whole ſtreſs of War would have reſted on him and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deſired to be excuſed, adding that he meant not long to conſerve the peace, therefore deſired that he and the Baſſa of <hi>Buda</hi> might have it in joynt Commiſſion to raiſe ſuch Forces as they thought convenient to invade the Empire, when opportunity offered, but this requeſt not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the intereſt of the Sultan it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
               <p>About this time the <hi>Janizaries</hi> in a tumultuary way came to the Court and demanded all the Offices of gain, and to be Stewards of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Churches which are great as likewiſe to take the Farms of Cuſtoms wherein they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many outrages, the Viſiers not daring to deny them any thing they demanded. They drunk Wine in the ſtreets without prohibition contrary to their Law, and exacted money of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to purchaſe it, and if denyed took it by force, and murthered without being puniſhed, and when at any time complaint was made the Magiſtrates anſwered they durſt not meddle with them, that had murthered their King, and the Baſſa's them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deſired the complainants patience, telling them that they would bear a part with the general ſufferance.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time the <hi>Janizaries</hi> in the Gallies which rid before <hi>Smirna</hi> commanded by <hi>Halil</hi> Baſſa,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57574:240"/>aſlaulted againſt his will the houſes of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Conſuls, inſomuch that the Engliſh Conſul with all thoſe of that Nation, were forced to run naked from their Lodgings, and ſave their lives by ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Admirals Gally, upon which the maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Turks ranſacked the lower part of the houſe there, making ſpoil to the value of Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Dollars. The French ſuſtained more loſs, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> at leaſt ten Thouſand Dollars, the Conſul having likewiſe one of his men cut in pieces, nor could the Admiral either by threats or intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties reſtrain theſe outrages, but was forced for the prevention of further miſchief to put to Sea.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Aſia</hi> there were three Rebellions, one at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> another at <hi>Arzirum</hi> upon the borders of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and a third at <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ruine of all <hi>Aſia;</hi> yet to prevent the worſt ſeveral new officers were made, and an Army rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>Grecia,</hi> in order to paſs the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> but in the end nothing was done more then aſſembling to little purpoſe, all the Turkiſh Forces on <hi>Europe</hi> ſide, which ſo impoveriſhed the Treaſury that the like had not formerly been known, nor were any Exactions and Extortions omitted to raiſe mony for defraying the neceſſary charges.</p>
               <p>About this time came to the Court of <hi>Poland,</hi> an Ambaſſador from the great Duke of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat a peace, which was hardly granted by reaſon ſeveral Letters of the ſaid Ambaſſadors being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, plainly demonſtrated that at his firſt ſetting out his deſigns were otherwiſe, upon notice that a Peace was concluded with the Sultan, he feigning himſelf ſick upon the Frontiers, had ſent for new inſtructions.</p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:57574:241"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Darut</hi> Baſſa who had married Sultan <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Siſter falling into the diſpleaſure of the Viſier, he ſo dealt with the <hi>Spahi,</hi> that coming to the Court they demanded his Head for the murthering the late Emperour, and having gotten him into their hands were about to behead him, but whilſt he was upon his knees, every woman expecting the fatal blow, the <hi>Janizaries</hi> at the inſtance of the <hi>Sultans</hi> Mother reſcued him and carryed him to their Colledge, promiſing him their protection, for which he beſtowed amongſt them Forty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Chequins. But that availed not, for ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was taken thence and carryed to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon where he had murthered young <hi>Oſman</hi> and there ſtrangled, now the better to pleaſe the <hi>Polonians</hi> and obſtruct the cauſe of War for the future, the Ambaſſador was not only diſpatched with ſeveral Noblemen of <hi>Poland,</hi> who had ſince the late War remained Priſoners, but it was likewiſe concluded that <hi>Jehan Begh,</hi> the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Prince, Author of the War ſhould be depoſed, and <hi>Michmet Geheray</hi> his Coſen, and firſt of the Blood, late Priſoner at the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> ſhould ſucceed him in that large King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſia</hi> was ſtill in doubt to be loſt for that <hi>Abaſſa</hi> Baſſa Governour of <hi>Arzirum,</hi> with an Army of one hundred thouſand Horſe and Foot had ſiezed upon moſt of the Provinces, though without doing any harm to the inhabitants, but whereſoever he found any of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> he ſacrificed them to the Ghoſt of the dead Emperour, he as he ſaid being by God appointed the revenger of his Death, and for that cauſe he had taken up arms declaring that he would come to the Port and demand Juſtice upon the Murtherers, and that if he was found a Traytor or
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57574:241"/>guilty, he would lay down his head willingly; but if thoſe he accuſed were found guilty, he would ſee execution done, nor did the Nobility of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> much diſapprove of his march, rather eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a friend then an Enemy, who came to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them from the Tyranny of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> whoſe inſolencies were inſufferable. Yet to prevent the worſt it was reſolved that <hi>Muſtapha</hi> ſhould be depoſed, the <hi>Janizaries</hi> not gainſaying it, for that they well knew they alone ſhould be expoſed to the fury of the Baſſa, at the rooting out of whoſe order he chiefly aimed, though he had likewiſe other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes which were to wreſt the Grand Viſierſhip from him that held it, and make himſelf Governour of the young Prince Brother to <hi>Oſman,</hi> whom he intended to advance to the Empire; yet rather for ſhew then otherwiſe the Souldiers were ordered to paſs the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> in great numbers, but the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi> would not ſtir for two reaſons, firſt for that the time of receiving their pay was at hand, and ſecondly fearing alone to be expoſed to the fury of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Army, greatly doubting that if it came to a Battle their Fellows would revolt, and by that means eaſily bring them to deſtruction.</p>

               <p>IN this diſtraction of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, the better to calm the tempeſt ere it turned all into confuſion by Shipwracking the State, the Grand <hi>Viſier</hi> going with the <hi>Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Spahi</hi> to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> demanded to ſpeak with <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and that he would anſwer them a few queſtions, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ways able to do, and refuſing to appear they entered the Palace, and took thence <hi>Morat</hi> or <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> Brother to <hi>Oſman,</hi> and Son to <hi>Achmat</hi> then about 14 years of Age, and carrying him through the ſtreets in triumph, cauſed him every where to be proclaimed Emperour to the great content of the <hi>Conſtantinopolitans,</hi> who by this mutation hope for peaceful times, and the face of Juſtice reſtored which for many months had abandoned the City, every man doing in a manner what he pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Thed ay after this innovation the young Emperor made his publique entry, from whoſe lively coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and apparent activity, every one promiſed great things during his Reign; but at that time ſuch had been the policy of the covetous Souldiers whom <hi>Muſtapha</hi> had continually ſupplyed with the Imperial Treaſure, to ſupport his bad Title to the Turkiſh Diadem, that Money was wanting to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply neceſſary occaſions. Inſomuch that the <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> were obliged to remit the Largeſs uſually beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57574:242"/>upon with an Augmentation of their pay at the Coronation of every Emperour, and that money which was found was for the moſt part adulterated, inſomuch that the Viſier ſent to the Ambaſſadors of the Chriſtian Princes reſiding there to borrow Thirty Thouſand Dollars, and narrow ſearch was made after the Treaſure that had been conveyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the Baſſa's that bore ſway during the diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in which ſearch Eight Hundred Thouſand Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars were found that had been imbezled by the Viſier <hi>Darut.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During theſe Tranſactions <hi>Abaſſa</hi> Baſſa had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed himſelf of all moſt all <hi>Aſia,</hi> whereupon it was thought neceſſary by fair means to perſwade him to lay down his Arms, and the rather to induce him ſo to do, the Emperour ſent unto the <hi>Capigi</hi> Baſſa with a Veſt, Sword and Letters of Credence giving him thanks for the love he had ſhewed to his Brother and his Blood, but now the revenge belonged to himſelf of which he would take care, and therefore deſired him if he were a true ſubject as he profeſſed himſelf to be to return to his Government of <hi>Arzirum,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having diſſolved his Army, and there to reſt till further occaſion required his ſervice. Upon this order from the Emperor he excuſed himſelf, that the far advancement of the ſeaſon would not permit him to retire, but promiſed to live in peace until the ſpring and then to return in obedience to his Government. Nor was this all for the Baſſa or <hi>Emir</hi> of <hi>Sidon</hi> was up in Arms, and with an Army of Thirty Thouſand men had ſeized the ſtrong City and Caſtle of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus,</hi> and was ſuppoſed to hold confederacy with the Chriſtian Princes being himſelf no favourer of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> ſuperſtition, and beſides he was a Prince by deſcent and claimed a right to thoſe Countries, as the antient inheritance of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57574:243"/>nor was the Emperor in a condition to repreſs him by force, therefore intreaties were uſed as to the former with many large promiſes, nor was the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvanian</hi> Prince quiet though in a different nature, for contrary to his League with the Emperor in a hoſtile manner he entered <hi>Hungary,</hi> and poſſeſſed himſelf of ſeveral Towns: To oppoſe whom the Imperialiſts raiſed a conſiderable Army and incamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the way he was to paſs, yet was his coming ſo ſuddain that he cut off ſeven hundred ſtraglers of the Imperialiſts, and had ſurprized the Camp had not the alarum been given by ſome that fled, yet with his whole Army he ſo preſſed them, that they were forced to betake themſelves to a ſmall Town <hi>Gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> upon the River of <hi>Moran,</hi> where they Fortified under a Caſtle that defended it; but in the end oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with cold and hunger they ſent to the Prince to make truce which with the conſent of Sultan <hi>Morat</hi> was accorded on theſe conſiderations. Firſt, That the Emperour ſhould diſclaim all right to <hi>Hungary,</hi> and ſhould leave the people free under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania.</hi> Secondly, That the Prince and all the Provinces that had ſent their Ambaſſadors to the Port, and had made league with him, and had taken the Imperial protection ſhould be reſtored to their antient Liberty and Eſtates. Thirdly, That the Emperor ſhould pay an annual Tribute of forty thouſand Dollars, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be granted in the dayes of <hi>Solyman</hi> for <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> and that the Prince, and the Baſſa of <hi>Buda,</hi> ſhould have full power, if they found it convenient at any time to conclude a Peace on the part of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperor, and that all Cities, Towns, and Caſtles ſhould remain in the hands of thoſe that poſſeſſed them, a free intercourſe of Trade being
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57574:243"/>allowed between the Subjects of the one and the other Empire.</p>
               <p>This done the Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> made ſhew as if he would redeem all the poor Captives taken by the Turks at his own charge, with ſome ſmall aſſiſtance from the Imperialiſts, upon whom he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fault, that it was not done, for as much as they failing to ſend their Commiſſioners to treat about the matter, the Turks in the night time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, and carried away with them contrary to his pleaſure twenty thouſand Chriſtians into miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Captivity. He likewiſe warned the Turks to keep in order and not to ſtraggle in their retreat, nor to commit any inſolency or ſpoil, for that the Country was all in Armes, and already inraged, but they not following his Council two thouſand <hi>Hungarian</hi> Horſe fell upon their Rear, and cut off ſix hundred of them; whereupon they turned head and deſtroyed many Villages, killing and taking Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners all that came to hand, and amongſt the reſt one of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Lords.</p>
               <p>By this time the <hi>Perſian</hi> deſirous to diſmember the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, with a powerful Army entred the Turkiſh Dominions in the Province of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and greatly Alarumed that City, whereupon a war was proclaimed againſt him at the Port, and all Souldiers in the Emperors pay commanded to repair to the rendezvous upon pain of Confiſcation, and their wives and children being ſold for ſlaves, it was likewiſe propounded that a reconciliation ſhould be made between the Emperor and <hi>Abaſſa</hi> Baſſa at any rate, leaſt he ſhould joyne with the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and that being ſo gained he might be imployed as General of Turkiſh Army, but the Janizaries would not hear of the advancement of their mortal enemy, but rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eſired to be led againſt him and fight it out to the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57574:244"/>utmoſt, but the <hi>Spahi</hi> were of another mind, as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclinable to the Baſſa, yet the Janizaries diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed their <hi>Aga,</hi> for diſſwading them therefrom, and ſet up in his ſtead a page of the Court.</p>
               <p>Thus whilſt it was unreſolved how to proceed, the <hi>Perſian</hi> King omitted no opportunity, but Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Province and City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> put to flight <hi>Hafis</hi> Baſſa, General of that defenſive war, and took priſoner <hi>Chur Haſſen</hi> Baſſa a renowned old Souldier, and cutting in pieces all that oppoſed him, found means to ſeize upon <hi>Moſul</hi> (antiently called <hi>Ninivie</hi>) and <hi>Laska,</hi> on the <hi>Perſian</hi> Sea, and dividing his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſent part towards <hi>Van</hi> and <hi>Diarbeck,</hi> and the other towards <hi>Mecha,</hi> incompaſſing by that means all that part of the Turks Dominions.</p>
               <p>About this time his Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> by his Ambaſſador reſiding at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the injuries his Subjects Trading in thoſe Seas, had ſuſtained by the Pirates of <hi>Argier</hi> and <hi>Tunis,</hi> who in two years ſpace, had taken about one hundred Engliſh Veſſels, moſt of them richly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, wherefore the Ambaſſador demanded that they might be puniſhed for violating the League, and be forced to reſtore ſuch Veſſels with their lading, as were found not to be imbezled, or that they might be left to his Majeſty to puniſh without any offence to the Grand Seigneour, but many of the Baſſas being intereſted in thoſe Piracies, nothing more could be procured then a Letter to the Baſſas of thoſe two Cities, to ſend their Commiſſioners to to the Port, to anſwer to what was objected againſt them, and at length to promiſe not any more to moleſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in order to the confirmation of which, ſeveral Articles were drawn, and delivered to Sir <hi>Thomas Rowe,</hi> then reſiding at the Port, with

               <p>Things falling out thus in <hi>Tartary,</hi> the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> taking the advantage of the Turkiſh Fleets abſence, with Eighty Boats or ſmall Barks entered the ſtraights of <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> where lying before <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> they brought a general fear upon that great City, and after having plundered and razed ſeveral Towns upon the Sea Ceaſt, they returned in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph unoppoſed, which good ſucceſs imboldened them with a greater number of Veſſels to adventure a ſecond time, when as before they returned with a great booty, the Turks not being able to prevent it. About the ſame time the Pirates of <hi>Tunis</hi> and <hi>Argiers</hi> revolted from the Grand Signeours obedience, and robbed many of his Ports in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> taking ſuch Ships as they found therein, and ſetting fire to a great number of Storehouſes, ſo that the loſs the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Merchants ſuſtained by them in one Expedition amounted to 4 Millions of Ducates, nor did they leſs harm by Land to ſuch as bordered on their Country, neither regarding Friends or Foes any longer then ſtood with their conveniency and profit, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Enemies to all men; which inteſtine troubles obliged <hi>Morat</hi> to conclude a Peace with <hi>Mechmet,</hi> the <hi>Tartar</hi> Prince diſſembling the intentions he had to depoſe him, laying all the fault of what had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Captain Baſſa, whoſe head had like to have gone off to have rendered his Maſters ſtory plauſible, ſuch danger are thoſe in that live under a Tyrant, whoſe will is his Law, not weighing Juſtice nor good deſerts further then may ſerve his purpoſe. Yet blood was not wanting for <hi>Huzein</hi> Baſſa who ſometime before fled, being taken and brought to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where (after in hopes to ſave his Life, he had confeſſed his Treaſure) he was ſtrangled. <hi>Abaſſa</hi> Baſſa notwithſtanding the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhews he made to march againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:57574:246"/>linger'd greatly, which gave the Janizaries a ſuſpicion that he had contrived the matter only to draw them into his danger, and then to deſtroy them as he had formerly purpoſed, which opinion of theirs had turned all again into confuſion, had he not at that inſtance reconciled himſelf to the Grand <hi>Viſier,</hi> and proteſted that he would not hurt the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> but uſe his Arms in defence of the Empire. So that by ſwearing three times on the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that no violence ſhould be done on either ſide, all animoſities vaniſhed, the Government of <hi>Arzirum</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to him, and he allowed a competent number of Souldiers to guard the frontires, as likewiſe places of truſt beſtowed upon moſt of his chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, but upon the <hi>Janizaries</hi> putting many of his Friends to the Sword who had yielded themſelves to the Grand Viſier, he in a rage fell into their quarter, making ſlaughter of three or four thouſand of them, though not without the loſs of as many of his own men, but finding that the Viſier had drawn up his Army in Battalia, he ſounded the retreat and marched to his Government, and the Viſier kept on his way towards <hi>Diarbecher</hi> to ſeek the <hi>Perſian,</hi> when in the mean time the <hi>Perſian</hi> General treated with <hi>Abaſſa</hi> to deliver up the City of <hi>Arzirum,</hi> to the King his Maſter promiſing in lieu thereof great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but he knowing upon ſuch terms he could at any time make his peace who ever was Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, ſeemingly hearkened to that motion; ſo that gaining credit eight thouſand <hi>Perſians</hi> was ſent to take poſſeſſion thereof, who he no ſooner got with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his danger, but he ſet upon them, put one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to the Sword, and took moſt of the remainder Priſoners, which cauſed the Turk to have a better opinion of him then formerly, inſomuch that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57574:246"/>they nominated him for Grand Viſier the enſuing year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1625. a new Rebellion broke out in <hi>Aſia,</hi> headed by an ordinary <hi>Spahi,</hi> who drew down ten thouſand men before the City of <hi>Smirna,</hi> the which after ſome reſiſtance he entered, and pretending to reform abuſes cut off the heads of two <hi>Cadees,</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed divers others, place and diſplaced the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates as he pleaſed, and then departed without ſuffering any ſpoil to be made, pretending the Grand Signeours order for what he had done, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Court connived at his proceedings, for awing corrupt Officers, he reſtored the face of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in thoſe parts, but not long after, he with a greater power marched toward <hi>Bruſſia</hi> in <hi>Natolia,</hi> uſing the Name of <hi>Morat</hi> to colour his purpoſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to work a Reformation in the State, but in the ending of great preparations were making to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, he disbanded his Army and retired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And now the mortality raged at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in ſuch ſort, that Fifty thouſand died in a ſhort ſpace, ſo that the City was left almoſt deſolate; which known to the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> they came again in their Boats, and ſailing through the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> made great ſpoil on <hi>Europe</hi> ſide, attempting to burn the Arſenal, to prevent which all the Gallies and ſmall Veſſels in the Port were manned out, ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them there happened a fierce ingagement; but the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> Boats being ſmall though many in number, thirty of them by the ſhot of the Gallies were ſunk and overturned, inſomuch that five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Coſſacks</hi> were drowned and taken Priſoners, and double the number of Turks ſlain, for the Boats being in all three hundred, and each Boat manned with thirty or forty Muſquetiers, they ſhowered
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57574:247"/>their Bullets ſo thick upon the Decks of the Gallies, that ſcarce a Turk peeped out but he was cut off; twice they boarded the Admirals Gally, and had taken it had not the Sea of a ſuddain gone high, and the Wind ſtood againſt them.</p>
               <p>Upon the approach of great Viſier towards the Province of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> ſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a Treaty of Peace, which was only to protract time, it in the end coming to nothing, yet the Princes of <hi>Georgia</hi> ſent their Ambaſſadors, as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be freed from the <hi>Perſian</hi> yoke, which Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors were kindly entertained by the Viſier, their demands granted, and the Biſhop of <hi>Calcedon</hi> their Countrey man ſent back with them to ſee the Peace Ratified; upon which they raiſed a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and invaded the Territories of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe whom the King ſent part of his Army under the leading of his great Leiutenant, who joyning Battle was overthrown, with the loſs of ſeven thouſand of his men, which greatly incouraged the Viſier, ſo that he reſolved the next year to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege <hi>Babylon,</hi> in which was a Garriſon of eight thouſand <hi>Perſians,</hi> beſides the Citizens who were five times the number, yet early in the Spring.</p>

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1626. having refreſhed his Army, he pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Camp before that great City, but as they were making their approaches Twenty Thouſand <hi>Perſian</hi> Horſe, who attended the motion of the Turks, fell into the Viſiers quarter doing great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and by that means troubled the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but in fine the <hi>Perſians</hi> were obliged to retire, yet not before they had ſlain about Six Thouſand Turks, upon which a muſter was taken of the Army, which was found much leſs then was expected for that a number of the <hi>Spahi</hi> and <hi>Janizaries</hi> that were
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57574:247"/>inroled, had forborn to undertake that dangerous, and ſo often fatal Expedition, and ſeven Princes of the <hi>Arabs</hi> Tributaries to the Grand Signeour hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed their power, refuſed to advance any further then the Borders of their Principalities, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that they durſt not diſpleaſe the poſſeſſors of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but were ready to obey if the City fell into the hands of the Turks, which weakneſs known to the <hi>Perſian</hi> King he drew thither the ſtrength of his whole Kingdom, and running Trenches round about the Turks Camp, beſieged it in ſuch manner that all Proviſions and Succors was cut off, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of hoping to win the City, they were ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of nothing more then how to retreat. This danger of the Army was made known to the Emperor and <hi>Divano</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but nothing was done till it was too late, for through want and diſeaſes the Army was ſo waſted, that they were no wayes able to make head againſt their Enemies; beſides a great number of them were ſlain in the frequent fallies the beſieged made out of the City, and the <hi>Perſians</hi> Incurſions, who ſeldom failed to beat up one quarter or other of the Camp, and hearing of no ſupplies durſt advance, or were in a probability to relieve the half ſtarved Souldiers, who had left no unclean thing uneaten, it was reſolved that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the favour of the night the Camp ſhould riſe and force a way through the <hi>Perſian</hi> Squadron, rather chooſing to die like men then pine with hunger; Whereupon they brake their great Artilery, and caſt into the <hi>Euphrates</hi> all ſuch things as they could not convey away, to prevent their falling into the hands of the Enemy, and then with as little noiſe as poſſible, broke through one quarter of the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Camp, yet not ſo ſuddainly but that the <hi>Perſians</hi> taking the Alarum, overtook them ere they reached

                  <hi>Ninive,</hi> and had the execution of the Army for the ſpace of ten dayes, in which time ſeventy thouſand Turks and <hi>Tartars</hi> fell by the Sword, when to caſt the odium upon the Baſſa's, and to ſave his credit at the Port the Viſier cauſed three of their heads to be ſtricken off. This great blow cauſed the revolt of many Cities, upon the Frontires of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and indangered the revolt of all <hi>Aſia.</hi> The Turks not having received the like blow, ſince the overthrow of <hi>Bajazet</hi> the firſt by <hi>Tamerlane</hi> the great, which cauſed a general heavyneſs throughout the City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> few therein but loſt one Friend or other in this unfortunate War, of which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Germanies</hi> Ambaſſador taking advantage preſſed for a ſpeedy concluſion of Peace, and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to croſs the purpoſe of the <hi>Tranſylvanian</hi> Prince, but in the interim the Imperial and <hi>Tranſylvanian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being abroad, on the 16th. of <hi>October</hi> near to the River <hi>Gran</hi> a mortal Battle was fought between them, wherein the latter was put to the rout, and in paſſing confuſedly the River over two Bridges layed for that purpoſe, Six thouſand were ſlain drowned and taken Priſoners, yet Winter coming on the Prince retired with his Troops, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of the Turks made a Truce with the Imperialiſts for three months, ſending to the Port to excuſe himſelf for ſo doing, by ſhewing the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that induced him ſo to do. But ere a Peace could be concluded as was intended Count <hi>Mansfelt</hi> and Duke <hi>Erneſtus,</hi> who were the greateſt inciters thereto died, ſo that nothing for a time was done therein, but it was left in the power of the Prince, and Baſſa of <hi>Buda</hi> to War upon the Emperour, as they found it convenient or moſt advantagious, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they raiſed great forces intending to make <hi>Auſtria</hi> the ſeat of War, but upon further ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57574:248"/>that deſign was layed aſide, all Parties being more deſirous of Peace then War, and ſo matters were left doubtful.</p>
               <p>About this time an Ambaſſador from the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> with overtures of Peace arrived at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> but could get no Audience of the Viſier, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there with his broken Army till an other Ambaſſador with preſents arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he made ſuch overtures that they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by many, but the non-delivery of <hi>Babylon</hi> a little before taken by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> put a ſtop to the negotiation, the Turks not being willing upon any other Terms to hearken to Peace, for that their Army in <hi>Aſia</hi> was by this time recruited and again entered into <hi>Perſia,</hi> to avert which the <hi>Perſians</hi> beſieged <hi>Achiska</hi> a ſtrong City near <hi>Arzirum,</hi> being incouraged thereto by <hi>Abaſſa</hi> Baſſa, to whom the Viſier ſent to draw out his forces, and in conjunction with the <hi>Georgians,</hi> to joyn with ſuch forces as he ſhould ſend him which were three thouſand <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> under the leading of twelve Captains, with whom he ſent Proviſion and other neceſſaries, but for the hatred the Baſſa had to that order he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to be ſet upon in the night, and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all cut in pieces, thoſe that remained and were taken Priſoners he ſent to the <hi>Perſian</hi> King, and then with ſuch forces as he had Fortified himſelf in <hi>Arzirum.</hi> The news of this diſgrace coming to the ear of the Viſier, he drew down with all his forces toward the Rebel, reſolving to puniſh him if he could by any means get him into his hands.</p>
               <p>Now the treaty between the Imperial Miniſters, thoſe of the Grand Signeours and <hi>Tranſylvanian</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:57574:249"/>Princes growing ripe, a Peace was concluded though ſeverally, for the Prince having underſtood that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> who was coming to his aid had been overthrown by <hi>Walſtain</hi> the Emperours Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and that the Baſſa of <hi>Buda</hi> bought with <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Gold, had croſſed all his purpoſes at <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and diſcovered his inmoſt Councils, he grew jealous of his own ſtate, and therefore thought it beſt to make Peace whilſt he was in a capacity to obtain honourable condition, which Treaty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in ten Articles were Ratified at <hi>Presburg.</hi> The chief points of which were, That either ſide ſhould ceaſe from Hoſtilities, and forbear directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to aſſiſt each others Rebells, and that all the City and Towns taken in the late War, ſhould be redelivered. Nor were the Turks ſlow in finiſhing their Treaty, as being no ways able to maintain an Army in <hi>Europe</hi> by reaſon of their troubles in <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſo that much to the ſame purpoſe as the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in eleven Articles, the Peace was concluded at the Port, to the great joy of all parties eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the Turks, who were now at leaſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their Towns, and quell the Rebellions in <hi>Aſia.</hi>

               <p>With this Letter and ſeveral preſents, Sir <hi>Thomas Rowe</hi> imbarqued on the <hi>Sampſon Frigat,</hi> in order to ſail for <hi>England,</hi> but coming before <hi>Malta,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there becalmed, four Gallies came out of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and ſet upon the Engliſh Veſſel, but after ſeven hours hot diſpute were forced to retire with the loſs of thirty ſix Knights of the Order, and two
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57574:251"/>hundred ſixty four common Souldiers and Rowers, when in the <hi>Sampſon</hi> only one Jew a Paſſenger was killed, and about ſix men wounded, yet the Ship was grievouſly rent with Culverin ſhot, and had been loſt had the Sea been outragious.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Peter Wyche</hi> His Majeſty of great <hi>Brittains</hi> new Ambaſſador at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> had not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there before ſome diſturbance happened, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by one <hi>William-Bundock</hi> an Engliſh Captains taking a Ship belonging to the Port, as ſhe was ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Meſſina,</hi> which cauſed the owners to demand with much clamour reparation, inſomuch that the <hi>Chimacham</hi> or Chief Officer of the Port, cauſed an Imbargo to be layed upon two Engliſh Veſſels then riding at Anchor in the Haven of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> nor could the Ambaſſador procure their releaſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a promiſe of reparation for the dammages ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained, and that the Actor ſhould be puniſhed, nor would the inſolent Souldiers though no way inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed therein till five hundred Dollars were beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1629. The Grand Signeour after much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in counſel, made Proviſion to renew the War in <hi>Perſia,</hi> as the only deſign of Honour and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, for though the Turkiſh Empire ingaged in many troubles required a judicious and more then common providence to ſupport it, beſet with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers on every ſide, and bearing more apparent ſigns of its declination then ever. Yet the diſgrace of <hi>Halil</hi> Baſſas retiring from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Aczirum,</hi> and the loſs of the Treaſure and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, ſo inſpired <hi>Huſſeruph</hi> the new General with revenge, that he deſired nothing more then to blot out thoſe ſtains that Eclipſed the Turkiſh Diadem, whereupon having recruited his Army, he came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57574:252"/>
                  <hi>Babylon,</hi> but after ſome bravadoes retired to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> without performing any thing worthy men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and there to ſatisfie his mutinous Souldiers, exacted mony of all the Merchants ſtrangers and native inhabitants, incouraging every baſe fellow to accuſe Rich perſons of one crime or other, and then himſelf ſitting as Judge would lay great fines on them, which they muſt pay or be impriſoned, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the the like pretence he impriſoned the Engliſh Conſul reſiding there, and hanged his <hi>Bruggerman</hi> or Interpreter, which inſolencies made known to His Majeſties Ambaſſador at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the Grand Signeour but had no redreſs. Yet within a while after his ill conduct being made known he was diſplaced, and <hi>Haffis Achmat</hi> Baſſa made great Viſier in his ſtead, though not without much difficulty, could he be induced to render his charge, for having by large Bribes won the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, he fortified himſelf in <hi>Moſul</hi> or <hi>Ninive</hi> biding defiance to his Maſter, yet at length he was reduced to obedience, but would not truſt himſelf in the City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but at a diſtance plotted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, and therein proceeded ſo far that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Spahi</hi> to mutiny, and force the Grand Signeour to deliver into their hands the new Viſier, whom they inſtantly tore in pieces, and not ſo contented they made a further demand of the <hi>Mufti</hi> and <hi>Teftarder</hi> put into their power, but at the earneſt intreaty of <hi>Morat</hi> they were appeaſed, though not before he promiſed to made <hi>Huſſeruph</hi> a ſecond time Viſier, and that <hi>Regeb</hi> Baſſa ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate till his arrival.</p>
               <p>The ſtorm allayed the Grand Signeour began to conſider that <hi>Huſſeruph</hi> had raiſed it by the Influence he had upon the Souldiers, and therefore leaſt he ſhould attempt any thing further, ſecret order was
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57574:252"/>given to the Baſſa of <hi>Buda</hi> in whoſe Government he reſided to ſend his head to Court, which was done accordingly, but not ſo privately but that the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers getting notice thereof, ſuddenly made up their many headed monſter, and in a great rage came to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> demanding the heads of thoſe that had been any way councelling or conſenting to the death of <hi>Huſſeruph,</hi> otherwiſe they threatned all with ruin, but having no anſwer ſuitable to their minds they ran to the houſe of <hi>Regeb,</hi> demanding of him who it was that had councelled ſo great a wickedneſs. Whereupon to ſave his Life (which was then in no ſmall danger) he proteſted he knew not, and that himſelf was innocent of the matter, yet they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him with them to the Palace, and made him their Orator to demand what they deſired, upon which the <hi>Aga Mufti</hi> and <hi>Teftardar</hi> with a private Servant of the Grand Signeours fled, but the latter being the next day taken and ſent back, he was delivered up as a ſacrifice to the inſolent Souldiers, who after their uſual manner in ſuch like caſes tore him in pieces. Yet they were not ſo contented, but upon a rumour that the Grand Signeour had put his three Brethren to death, they broke into the Palace and could hardly be quieted, although the young Princes were produced, and that ſeveral of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers ſwore upon the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that they ſee the grand Signeour lay his hand upon the book and ſwore they ſhould have their demands ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>In theſe Tumults the goods of Merchants ſtrangers went to wrack, and divers affronts and indignities were offered the ſeveral Ambaſſadors reſiding at the Port, nor was this all, for about the ſame time <hi>Eleas</hi> Baſſa Rebelled againſt the Grand Signeour, and ſiezed upon the City of <hi>Amaſia</hi> about a League from <hi>Smirna,</hi> infeſting all the Countrey with divers
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57574:253"/>outrages, his Souldiers living altogether upon ſpoil, inſomuch that the Merchants and Conſuls at <hi>Smirna</hi> were forced to remove with their goods to <hi>Scio,</hi> but an Army being ſent againſt him, he was in a pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Battle diſcomfited and had moſt of his followers ſlain, himſelf hardly eſcaping, and now the Grand Signeour ſuppoſing <hi>Regeb</hi> Baſſa (though indeed he was not) the Author of the late tumults, ſent for him into the <hi>Seraglio</hi> and there cauſed him to be ſtrangled.</p>
               <p>About this time a fight for the ſpace of four hours was maintained by two Engliſh Merchantmen, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thirty of the Turks Gallies, till at laſt the Engliſh finding themſelves too weak for ſuch odds fired their Veſſels and caſt themſelves over board, where many of them periſhed, and thoſe that were taken up put to the Oares; in this fight a thouſand Turks were ſlain, and amongſt them ſeveral <hi>Begs</hi> and men of note, of this apparent injury done by the Turks, His Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter complained to the Grand Signeour, requiring that thoſe that were taken Captives might be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their Liberty, that ſo a right underſtanding might continue, but the Turks alledging that the Voyage of the two Ships were unlawful, by reaſon they Traded in the <hi>Levant</hi> for Corn, the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor could little prevail, and had much ado to ſave the lives of the Captives. Yet in the end to hinder the diſſolution of the Turkiſh Trade, and to pleaſe the Grand Signeour, a Decree paſſed in the Star Chamber prohibiting the Corn Trade in the <hi>Levant,</hi> upon which ſeveral of the Captives were ſet at Liberty.</p>
               <p>Three dayes after this action, a Fire happened in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> which conſumed Seventy Thouſand Houſes.</p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:57574:253"/>
               <p>The <hi>Perſian</hi> War yet continuing, that King with a great Army beſieged <hi>Van,</hi> a ſtrong City upon the Confines of <hi>Diarbecher,</hi> the news whereof arriving at the Port, great preparations were made to prevent that important place from falling into the hands of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> it being Decreed that all the <hi>Beghs</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſhould repair thither with ſuch forces as they could leavy, and endeavour its releif, and to joyn them the Grand Viſier paſſed over with all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi> Souldiers, but ere any thing could be done the City was taken, whereupon the Viſier marched towards <hi>Aleppo,</hi> exacting great ſums of money, and the better to furniſh himſelf, ſent the <hi>Cadee</hi> a ſlave to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and ſiezed upon all his Treaſure.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Turks under pretence of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians riſing, ſiezed all their Arms, making it death to thoſe in whoſe houſes any were found after a time prefixed, nor content with this they hanged a <hi>Venetian</hi> Merchant only for his Money, and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned all the Chriſtian Merchants in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſetting a ranſom of two thouſand Dollars upon each, and that if the money was not payed in four dayes they ſhould be executed. The four Ambaſſadors of <hi>England, France, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe convented before the Baſſas in the Arſenal, and charged for building a Houſe and Chappel without leave from the Grand Signeour, to have done it in contempt of his Imperial Majeſty, and much ado they had to eſcape being impriſoned, but in the end upon the Chappels being demoliſhed, and all the Armes they had in their Houſes delivered to an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer appointed to receive them, the Grand Signe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was pacified, though indeed this was uſed only as a trick to extort mony from them.</p>
               <p>This being the preſent ſtate of things in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Port, the Engliſh Ambaſſador in the behalf
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57574:254"/>of his King and Nation, made known the juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments of his Maſter, for the affront offered in the perſon of him his Ambaſſador, as likewiſe did the reſt exclaiming of injuſtice, inſomuch that the Captain Baſſa told them that indeed the proceedings were too rigid, and that for the future care ſhould be taken to prevent the like, as for their Armes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away he ſaid they had been ſeen by the Grand Signeour, and therefore could not be reſtored, but that they had liberty to buy more, and the money exacted of the Merchants could not at that time be reſtored by reaſon of the urgent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſtate, and therefore intreated them to be pacified, but the French Ambaſſador was ſo far fallen into the Grand Signeours diſpleaſure that his Death was determined, the execution whereof was with much danger to the diſſwaders deferred, and upon ſecond thoughts changed into an Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the cauſe of which was for that he had ſiezed upon ſixty thouſand Dollars ſent by the Town of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> to pay his Predeceſſors Debts contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which money he converted to his own uſe, thereby defrauding the Creditor and obliging them to clamour for Turkiſh Juſtice, which in it ſelf is cruelty and oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe inteſtine troubles gave the <hi>Perſians</hi> Liberty to make themſelves Maſters of many ſtrong places, which greatly alarumed the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that great preparations were every where made, the Grand Signeour in perſon intending to take the Field. But ere the Army could be raiſed and all things gotten in a readineſs, the <hi>Perſians</hi> were far advanced, and taken many places of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and amongſt the reſt <hi>Reivan</hi> a ſtrong place, Garriſoned by the Turks, taken from the <hi>Perſians</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:57574:254"/>the year before, putting all they found therein to the Sword and Ranſom.</p>
               <p>The report of theſe loſſes arriving, ere the Grand Signeour had put himſelf in a readineſs to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his Army, he layed aſide his purpoſe of going in perſon, and full of diſcontents remained at home to conſult his own ſafety, which was now threatned with ſuch a ſtorm, that to ſhun it was not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a poſſibility in humane Providence, for the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that were abroad began to expreſs their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, refuſing to receive their pay or to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Grand Viſier, for the Turks War with the <hi>Perſians</hi> unwillingly, there being no other cauſe for their invading each other then the emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of greatneſs, which has ſucceſſively fired the Lords of thoſe two mighty Empires. Beſides the Turks ſeldom meet in <hi>Perſia</hi> with any plentiful ſpoils, ſo that they are neither incited by their own freeneſs, nor allured by the hopes of any large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But on the contrary to the Wars of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> they haſt as to ſome delightful ſpectacle, induced thereto by a ſuperſtitious zeal, as making religion a ground for their attempts, and an aſſurance of large ſpoiles, where the Countries abound in all manner of Plenty.</p>
               <p>This danger of the Souldiers mutiny abroad reached not preſently the ears of the Grand Signe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to terrifie him with the apprehenſions of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtorm, for he had enough to do with the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries,</hi> who now began to ſuſpect another deſign on foot for the extirpation of their order which made them caſt off all obedience, and ſet the great City of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in an uproar, which obliged the Citizens every where to provide for their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for the unruly Souldiers having gotten the knack of making and unmaking Emperors at their
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57574:255"/>pleaſure, were grown to that height of inſolency that they ſuppoſed the center of Government to reſt in themſelves, and each individual man of them thought himſelf ſuperior to any Officer in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, inſomuch that they accounted the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neour but as their Steward intruſted by them with the Government, and that his Life and ſafety wholly depended on their pleaſure, which he well perceiving knew no better means to render them tractable, then by diſtributing large ſums of money amongſt them, which nevertheleſs at this time much availed not, for being bent on miſchief they plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the houſes of ſeveral Merchants and rich <hi>Burghers</hi> killing and wounding ſuch as reſiſted them, and in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ran to the Palace demanding ſuch Favourites as they named which being denyed, they preſently fell into a conſultation about depoſing their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Nay, ſo far proceeded that many perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take away his Life as they had done his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Oſmans,</hi> but ſo divided were they in their Councils, that they could come to no reſult at that time, but ſoon after aſſembling it was propoſed, that if the Grand Signeour would make amends by ſome acknowledgment of his ill intents toward them, and confirm their Order and Priviledges, his Government (he being one that was not inſenſible of their power) might prove advantagious to them, but that if his diſpoſition reſted yet undiſcovered, it might render the courſe of their Lives obnoxious to incertainties, for the Grand Signeour in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Reign, not exceeding fifteen years of age expreſſed a natural inclination to action, which wits his years increaſed, and this had ſettled ſome good opinion of him in the unruly Souldiers, whoſe deſire is War that by plunder they may inrich themſelves. Though of late many of the <hi>Janizaries</hi>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:57574:255"/>(contrary to their firſt inſtitution, and the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued courſe that former Emperors had obliged them to) had married Wives ſettled themſelves to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize and were become both rich and effeminate.</p>
               <p>In theſe and the like miſchievous conſultations many dayes were waſted, nor could the <hi>Janizaries</hi> wanting their uſual Confederates the <hi>Spahi,</hi> who were then under the leading of the Grand Viſier at <hi>Arzirum</hi> effect their purpoſe as they were wont which made them more cautious in their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and to keep together in one ſtrong and intire body as fearing to be deſtroyed by a general Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre if they ſeparated, ſuch a rumour (whether ſpread by themſelves to countenance them in their unlawful purpoſes or really intended) being ſpread about the City, and that in the room of them a new Militia ſhould be eſtabliſhed, leſs chargeable and more tractable, after the ſame method as <hi>Delavire</hi> Baſſa had formerly purpoſed, and that many were for that purpoſe inrolled on the Frontires, eſpecially <hi>European</hi> Horſemen that were continually in action to prevent the incurſions of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and free <hi>Heyducks,</hi> who living moſtly upon ſpoil greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammaged the Turks, but in the end a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding being created between the Emperour and the <hi>Janizaries</hi> by the mediation of the great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Court a Reconciliation was made, though not without a wonderful maſs of money diſtribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt the latter, who frequently mutiny for no other purpoſe then by ſuch means to inrich themſelves, well knowing that the Grand Signeour has no other way to appeaſe them, then by diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting large ſumms of mony amongſt them; nor were the Soldiers abroad ſatisfied till they had ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to their revenge the chief Treaſurer of the Army, the two <hi>Aga</hi>'s of the <hi>Spahi's</hi> and the <hi>Chiaus</hi>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:57574:256"/>Baſſa of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> nor till a new Viſier was ſent to diſcharge the Old one, and to lead them to the <hi>Perſian</hi> War.</p>
               <p>During theſe troubles an Ambaſſador from the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with many Rich preſents, which cauſed him to have the ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Audience, and promiſe of an honourable Peace, bur whilſt the Treaty held, the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> driven out of <hi>Poland</hi> by King <hi>Uladiſlaus,</hi> had ſiezed upon <hi>Aſac</hi> a ſtrong City of the Grand Signeours, ſcituate upon the mouth of the River <hi>Tanais,</hi> upon the declining of a Hill, which they pillaged and afterward For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, keeping poſſeſſion thereof for the ſpace of four years, at what time the Turk again recovered it, as alſo great troubles aroſe in <hi>Tartary,</hi> upon the <hi>Tartar Hans</hi> putting to death the Baſſa <hi>Muſti,</hi> and <hi>Cadi</hi> of <hi>Caffa,</hi> for reproving him of Coward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> The Life and Reign of Sultan <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> the Twefth Emperour of the Turks.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>MOrat</hi> being dead as is before recited, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> the onely Male ſurviver of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Race, was taken from the Priſon in which his Brother had confined him and proclaimed Emperor, though <hi>Morat</hi> in his Life time had by his will bequeathed his Empire to the <hi>Tartar.</hi> This new Emperor being of a ſoft nature ſuffered himſelf to be wholly governed by his Mother, and ſuch Miniſters as were about him, himſelf being altogether weak in his underſtanding. So that the War intended againſt the <hi>Germans</hi> was by the Council of the great Viſier reverted on the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> yet for ſome reaſon for a while ſuſpended, the great Viſier in the mean while ſtudying to take ſuch out of the way that might Eclipſe his grandure, and amongſt the reſt he cauſed the Captain Baſſa, the deceaſed Emperors Chief Favorite to be behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Seliſtra,</hi> whither he had ſent him Governour for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The news of Sultan <hi>Ibrahims</hi> advancement to the Throne, being known to the Chriſtian Princes, few of them deferred to ſend Ambaſſadors to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate him on that occaſion, each making him large Preſents as the manner is, for as 'tis often ſaid in this Hiſtory none may have Audience of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Emperour that comes empty handed.</p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:57574:259"/>
               <p>The Grand Signeour about this time greatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting himſelf to the uſe of Women, fell into an Apoplexy which put many in doubt of his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and raiſed the greater confuſion by reaſon he had no Children, and that it was given out by his Women with whom he had to do, that he was not capable of generation, therefore the Councellors conſulted amongſt themſelves, that in caſe he died without Iſſue the Son of a Siſter or Neece ſhould aſcend the Throne, and that in no wiſe the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion ſhould devolve to the <hi>Tartar,</hi> whoſe right it is upon the failure of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Male-line, but he ſoon after recovering of his indiſpoſition put them in ſome hopes, though that joy was damped by the advice that came to Court of the ruine of ſeveral Important Cities on the Frontires of <hi>Perſia</hi> by a terrible Earthquake. Yet the Grand Signeour to ſhow the World that he intended ſomething, gave Order to the Grand Viſier to beſiege <hi>Aſac,</hi> poſſeſſed by the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Morat,</hi> as is aforeſaid which he did both by Sea and Land, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great loſs of his beſt men, reduced it to the Turkiſh obedience, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1641. at what time it was abandoned by the Garriſon of <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> who deſpairing to hold it long departed with all their ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of the following year the doubt of the Grand Signeours improcreation vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for one of his <hi>Sultaneſſes</hi> brought forth a Son, who was named <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which repleniſhed the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Empire with joy, which Prince now ſways the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Scepter, during the Triumphs for the birth of the young Prince, the <hi>Perſian</hi> King by his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador renewed his League with the <hi>Sultan,</hi> which was performed upon an additional Article, that the Sophy would demoliſh the Fortreſs of <hi>Fortrina,</hi> which
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:57574:260"/>he had built contrary to Articles on the Frontires, not far from the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, which that it might aſſuredly be performed a <hi>Capugibathee</hi> was diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee it effected, after which a conſiderable bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Turks gathering together in <hi>Hungary,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſurprize <hi>

Yet that he might not be forgot abroad, he ſent out his Fleet of Gallies, under the command of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Baſſa, who after much Treaſure ſpent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effecting any thing, except ſtrangling the Baſſa of <hi>Cyprus</hi> for his ſtore of Wealth he returned.</p>
               <p>About this time a great Plague raging at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> about ſix thouſand ſlaves found means to eſcape and carry with them ſeveral Veſſels that rode at Anchor in the road, in which they conveyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>Candia</hi> and <hi>Malta,</hi> and from thence many of them found means to depart to their reſpective Countries, of which the Grand Signeour having notice, ſent to the Signory of <hi>Venice</hi> to command their redelivery, which not being performed afterwards occaſioned the loſs of <hi>Candia,</hi> as ſhall in the Reign of <hi>Mahomet</hi> the fourth be diſcourſed of more at large.</p>

               <p>Whilſt theſe matters were in agitation the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> forgetful of their late Peace, made an incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with thirty thouſand men into <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> againſt whom <hi>Koniſpolski</hi> having made head with twenty thouſand Horſe and Foot defeated them, killing twelve thouſand, and taking three thouſand Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners purſuing the remainder to the Borders of <hi>Valachia,</hi> in like manner <hi>Wiſnowick.</hi> a noble <hi>Polander</hi> happily encountering another party of <hi>Tartars,</hi> as they were returning from the ſpoil of a part of <hi>Moſcovia,</hi> killed ten thouſand of them, and recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a great booty, ſending the reſt naked into their own Countrey.

               <p>During theſe preparations the Grand Signeor fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his Laſcivious courſes keeping his female Court in ſuch ſplendor, that his greateſt Treaſure was ſpent therein, nor was all the Silks of <hi>Italy</hi> ſufficient to ſuffice his Women, but upon the falſe rumour that the deſign was againſt the <hi>Malteſians,</hi> they were not idle but in the beſt manner Fortified their chief places of ſtrength, yet in the end the ſtorm fell not there but upon <hi>Candia,</hi> for the Fleet of a hundred Gallies, and fifty great Ships with three hundered Saicks, moſt of the latter being preſſed for the tranſportation of Souldiers being arrived at <hi>Scio</hi> after refreſhment of the Army conſiſting of ſeven thouſand <hi>Janizaries,</hi> fourteen thouſand <hi>Spahies,</hi> fifty thouſand <hi>Timariots,</hi> three thouſand Pioners, beſides Cooks, Bakers and other neceſſary followers ſet ſail for <hi>Napoli Di Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magnia,</hi> and having ſtayed there ſome time weighed Anchor and touching at divers Iſlands, ſome belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and others not, they at length came to <hi>Candia</hi> (having taken a <hi>Venetian</hi> Veſſel laden with Ammunition, and bound for <hi>Retimo</hi> by the way) where no longer being able to hide their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions they unmasked themſelves, by publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the War both there and at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>

The opportunity was fair for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the Turks Fleet as it careleſly rod at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor near the Iſle of <hi>Theodoro</hi> oppoſite to <hi>Canea,</hi> where had the advantage been improved it might eaſily have been burnt, but ſuch was the contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Chriſtian Commanders, that nothing was attempted worthy of mention, whereupon <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lino</hi> General of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Land Forces was revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the Senate, and diſmiſſed of his high charge, <hi>Capello</hi> being appointed to ſucceed him, who being ſtrengthned with an additional ſupply of Gallies, Galliaſſes and Ships of War he waſted the Iſland, whilſt <hi>Moroſini</hi> with two and twenty Ships faced the Towers of the <hi>Dordanellis</hi> in the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and braved the <hi>Ottoman</hi> power incountering ſuch Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies as in a dead calm were ſent out againſt him, which
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:57574:263"/>after a ſharp diſpute he obliged to retire, and then ſailed to joyn his Admiral perſwading him to give the Turks Battle, but whilſt he delayed they land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an additional ſtrength of forty thouſand men on the Iſland, and kept their Gallies ſo cloſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Harbour that they could not be indammaged without great diſadvantage to the Chriſtians, nor did the Fire-Ships too late prepared to burn them ſucceed, by reaſon they took Fire too ſoon; yet the ſucceeding year <hi>Moroſini</hi> having notice that the Turks were Landed at <hi>Scio,</hi> and that they careleſly romed up and down, came thither with divers Ships of War took ſeveral of their Gallies, and in them many priſoners of note, but ſoon afterward being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from his Squadron in a ſtorm, he was ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by fifteen Gallies of <hi>Rhodes</hi> and boarded, where fighting valiantly he was ſlain by a Muſquet Bullet, yet his Ship upon the coming in of two Galliaſſes was reſcued. The funeral ſolemnity of this renowned Captain was celebrated with all Pomp at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not by Sea only but at Land the Turks invaded the <hi>Venetian</hi> Territories, for pouring a multitude of men into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> yet were not greatly ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for <hi>Leonardo Foſcolo</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> General, on that ſide overthrew their Forces in divers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts.</p>
               <p>In one of which he took the <hi>Sanzack Licca,</hi> and ſlew his Son, recovered <hi>Saccovar, Poliſſano, Iſlan,</hi> and <hi>Novogrode,</hi> the latter of which by order of the Senate he demoliſhed, and purſuing his good ſucceſs took all the Cities and Towns the Turks held on that ſide, utterly driving them out of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> but this joy was palliated by the unwelcome news of the Fleets being wrecked in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> and a great number of Ships and Gallies broken to pieces,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:57574:263"/>which ſo raiſed the drooping courage of the Turks that they advanced to the Walls of <hi>Candia,</hi> and ſtraitly beſieged it but were ſo valiantly repulſed by the Chriſtians that had put themſelves into it that after the loſs of thirty thouſand men they were obliged to retire as not being capable of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, though <hi>Foſcolo</hi> about this time proved ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in taking <hi>Cliſſa,</hi> a ſtrong Fort ſcituate in the confines of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and overthrew <hi>Feckeli</hi> Baſſa killing and taking Priſoners the greateſt part of his Army, which cauſed <hi>Morlaches</hi> to revolt, and ſeveral of the principal inhabitants of <hi>Scutary</hi> to treat with the <hi>Venetian</hi> General about putting that City into his hands, to take poſſeſſion of which ſeven thouſand men were ſent who ſeized ſome ſeveral ſmal places, but ere they could arrive at <hi>Scutari,</hi> their deſign was diſcovered and they obliged for the preſervation of their lives, to betake themſelves to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains for as many as were taken the Turks impailed them alive.</p>
               <p>The Grand Viſier inraged for the loſs of <hi>Cliſſa</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched <hi>Dervis</hi> Baſſa into part of <hi>Boſna</hi> with a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful Army to aſſault <hi>Spelatro,</hi> againſt whom the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> General marched together with <hi>Serich</hi> Capt. of <hi>Morlaches,</hi> but by reaſon of the Chriſtians diſorderly march, in gathering the ſpoil of the Countrey, the Turks ſet upon a part of the Army and put it to the rout, though <hi>Serich</hi> and other <hi>Dalmatian</hi> Captains did all that men could perform In this conflict 400 Chriſtians were ſlain and as many taken Priſoners, amongſt the latter of which was the Captain of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iaches</hi> whom the Turks flayed alive, and afterwards impailed, yet though they ſubdued his body they could not conquer his invincible mind, he bearing the ſame Conſtancy and Reſolution in his torments as he had done in Battle.</p>

               <p>During theſe tranſactions <hi>Ibrahim</hi> indulged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in all manner of pleaſures leaving the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all his affairs to his Baſſa, himſelf being wholly directed by a wench, who in the nature of a Baud or procurer went from bath to bath to take a view of the Ladies, and thoſe ſhe perceived fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, ſhe inquired out the places of their abode and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended them to her Lord, who upon hearing her praiſe their beauty would inſtantly be enamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them and ſend to fetch them either by fair means or force to his Bed. This courſe taken for a while without coutroul, ſhe at length filled his ears with the commendation of a Sultaneſs, Widow to his brother <hi>Morat</hi> deceaſed, but this Woman could by no intreaty be won to his Luſt, nor obliged with preſents to comply alledging ſhe had vowed perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Widowhood, and that her former Lord to was living in conceit, which denyal the more inraged <hi>Ibrahim</hi> now grown impatient of delay, wherefore he intended to ſnatch that by force that intreaty could not gain, wherefore watching her one day as ſhe came out of the Bath, he ſiezed her in his armes, which ſhe perceiving reſolved upon the defence of her Chaſtity, and therefore drew her Dagger (a weapon which the Sultaneſs and Chief Lady wear at their ſides) and offered to wound him in her own defence, which obſerving let go his hold, at what time the buſtle cauſing a loud clamour his Mother came from her apartment, who underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what had happened began to reprove her ſon of his laſcivious behaviour, during which the Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs found means to eſcape, which ſo incenſed <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> that he confined his Mother to the old <hi>Seraglio,</hi> interdicting her his preſence till with ſubmiſſion and many intreaties ſhe had obtained pardon.</p>

               <p>Pleaſed with this anſwer <hi>Ibrahim</hi> diſmiſſed the <hi>Mufti</hi> with ſeveral rich preſents, thinking his wiſhes ſhould now be ſatisfied, but the old man having hardened his Daughter not to accept this offer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with the unexpected news next morning, that notwithſtanding his perſwaſion and paternal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, his Daughter proved averſe contrary to his expectation, but the reaſon he knew not how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, ſince Women are commonly irregular and unreaſonable in their affections, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner diſappointed of what he moſt deſired, diſmiſſed the <hi>Mufti</hi> with neglect and diſdaign, as one who had deceived his truſt ſoon after baniſhed him the Court

               <p>The next day the <hi>Janizaries</hi> ariſing in like tumult as before, demanded of the <hi>Mufti</hi> whether according to their Law <hi>Ibrahim</hi> as a Fool, Tyrant, and one unfit to wield the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Scepter, ought not to be depoſed. To which the <hi>Mufti</hi> gave anſwer in the affirmative, and cauſed <hi>Ibrahim</hi> to be ſummoned the next day to appear in the <hi>Divano</hi> to adminiſter Juſtice to his Subjects, and Souldiers who expected it from him. But the Sultan ſuppoſing he had ſufficiently ſatisfied the Souldiers by putting the Grand Viſier out of office, laughed at the ſummons the <hi>Mufti</hi> had made him which being ſeconded by a <hi>Fetfa</hi> (which is a point of Law reſolved by the <hi>Mufti,</hi> who is the mouth and Oracle of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Grand Signeour called to account is obliged to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Juſtice.) The Sultan in high diſdaign tore the paper, threatning the head of the <hi>Mufti,</hi> but it was now too late he having ſurely fortified himſelf with the power and ſtrength of his rebellious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. This <hi>Fetfa</hi> was immediately ſeconded by a ſummons of a higher nature which declared that whoſoever diſobeyed the Law of God was not a true <hi>Muſſulman</hi> or believer, and though the Perſon of the Emperour himſelf, yet being become by his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a <hi>Rafir</hi> or Infidel was <hi>ipſo facto</hi> fallen from his Throne, and no further capable of Authority or Government. This <hi>Fetfa</hi> being ſeen by <hi>Ibrahim</hi> he likewiſe tore it, commanding the Grand Viſier in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to put the <hi>Mufti</hi> to death as guilty of Treaſon againſt his Emperour, but having by this time loſt his Authority, his commands were not obeyed, nor his perſon reverenced, for the <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> being aſſembled about five in the afternoon came with their uſual tumults to the gates of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> at whoſe approach <hi>Ibrahim</hi> loſing all courage fled to his Mother for protection, begging her aſſiſtance
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:57574:266"/>who being a bold and ſubtle Woman uſed all her Rhetorick and Eloquence to perſwade the Souldiers not to offer any violence to the perſon of their Lord, promiſing that he ſhould relinquiſh the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and retire himſelf with a guard into the Lodging out of which he was advanced to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> comforted a little that his Life was ſpared willingly ſubmitted himſelf a Priſoner, when in the mean time the Souldiers taking forth his Eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Son <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> placed him on the Throne, every where proclaiming him Emperour with loud Acclamations of which <hi>Ibrahim</hi> having notice grew impatient, and often with ſad laments beat his head againſt the Wall, till at length to put a ſtop to his fury four Mutes were ſent to ſtrangle him, who on the 17th. of <hi>Auguſt, Anno Dom.</hi> 1648. performed that barbarous exploit, ſo that according to the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of King <hi>Charles the firſt</hi> of Bleſſed Memory. <hi>There is but little diſtance between the Priſons and Graves of Princes.</hi>

Yet many skirmiſhes happened between theſe contrary Factions in the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:57574:267"/>ſtreets of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in which ſome hundreds were ſlain, but the <hi>Spahies</hi> being for the moſt part worſted at length abandoned the City.</p>
               <p>Theſe animoſities and diviſions amongſt the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Souldiers, gave the <hi>Venetians</hi> opportunity to provide for their defence, as expecting nothing leſs then a War, for that their Ambaſſador had been clapped up on Priſon for demanding Audience, and chains put upon him, but at the intreaty of the other Chriſtian Ambaſſadors there reſiding he was ſet at Liberty. Yet to affront him the Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier cauſed his <hi>Dugerman</hi> or Interpreter to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and his body thrown out at the Caſtle Window, which barbarous act is frequent amongſt the Turks, either to put a diſgrace upon the Ambaſſador, or to terrifie thoſe Interpreters that they ſhall not dare to ſpeak any thing after an Ambaſſador though up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Audience, that ſhould be ungrateful to the Grand Signeour, which cauſes them many times to mince their words and not render a true interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>Theſe matters widening differences between the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Turks, great preparations were made on either ſide, the former with all diligence reinforcing <hi>Candia,</hi> and the latter to hinder it; ſo that many skirmiſhed happened by Land and Sea, till at length the Baſſa Governour notwithſtanding the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet blocked up the <hi>Dardaneles,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received a recruit of 1500 men laid ſiege to the ſtrong City <hi>Candia,</hi> and battered it with many pieces of Ordinance, till at length having taken a ſmall Fort that flanked it, he lodged his men therein juſt as 6 Gallies of <hi>Malta</hi> arrived with 600 Voluntiers, and 60 Knights of the Order, who beat out the Turks with great ſlaughter, yet they retook it again and planted the <hi>Ottoman</hi> colours upon the higheſt Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:57574:268"/>which ſo inraged the Chriſtians that ſallying with all their force they drove the Turks from the Walls with great ſlaughter, regained the piece, and cauſed the Baſſa with ſhame and loſs to raiſe the ſiege.</p>
               <p>The Wars growing hot in <hi>Candia,</hi> the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents between the <hi>Spahi</hi> and <hi>Janizaries</hi> that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſed to be appeaſed grew hot again, and much ſlaughter happened between thoſe inveterate factions, when to pacifie the latter the great Viſier was depoſed and executed. Yet that little availed nor was that all for ſeveral of the Baſſa's denyed to return the Tribute of their Provinces, alledging they would reſerve it till the Grand Signeour was of age, and then be to him accountable both for principal and intereſt, nor were the Wars in <hi>Boſna, Dalmatia, Foſcolo,</hi> and other places on the <hi>Venetian</hi> Frontires neglected, but continued with doubtful ſucceſs, and great ſlaughter, yet part of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Forces on that ſide were diverted by the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> who at the inſtigation of the <hi>Tartar Han</hi> covered the Black Sea, with their Boats and committed many outrages in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> trembled at their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach as fearing a ſack by the hands of thoſe reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute people, but in the end having gotten a rich booty they returned to their ſtation.</p>

               <p>The Diet was not idle in ſtudying and contriving the preſervation of the Empire, but finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too weak, adviſed the Emperor to ſend his Ambaſſadors to his Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> His Majeſty of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute towards the defence of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> who all freely, either with Men or Money, ingaging in the common cauſe an Army of Four Thouſand Thirty Seven Horſe and Sixteen Thouſand Nine Hundred Ninety One Foot was Imbodied, and were promiſed ſucceſs the rather by reaſon of the Rebellion in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where ſeveral of the <hi>Begs</hi> had taken up Armes, and driven out the Baſſas, yet the difference amongſt the Chriſtian Commanders retarded their ſucceſs, and eſpecially ſome affronts put upon the renowned Count <hi>Serini,</hi> which not being taken notice of by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, he ſuppoſed he connived at them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore retired from the Army, which put a great ſtop to their proceedings, upon which the Turks incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged beſieged many places, but with ſmall ſucceſs, for in the end <hi>Huſaein</hi> Baſſa, General of the Turks Army being incountered by Count <hi>Soiſe</hi> chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the <hi>Imperials,</hi> he was overthrown with great ſlaughter of his men, when flying to <hi>Strigoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> he was denyed enterance, and obliged to March to <hi>Newhuſel,</hi> where he was received, the Garriſon there being thin, and the tempeſt of War at that time threatning that place.</p>

               <p>After the death of this Count, the Peace between the Empires was concluded, when as the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niour being at leaſure, plotted the deſtruction of his Brothers, but at the perſwaſion of the <hi>Muphti</hi> altered his Reſolution.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Venetian</hi> Galleys coaſting the Iſland of <hi>Candia,</hi> to hinder what in them lay the Landing of Forces on that Iſland, encountered with Twenty Ships of the <hi>Turks,</hi> laden with Men and Proviſion; moſt of which they burnt, ſunk, or took, and a while after had one of the Turkiſh Galleys brought to them by the Slaves, who had by ſtratagem taken it from their Maſters, but theſe proceedings ſeemed ſmall to what afterwards happened; for by this time the Viſier having layed his ſiege to one of the ſtrongeſt City in the World, fortified by the moſt induſtrious of men, as far as Humane poſſibility could render it impregnable, diſmal things inſued.</p>
               <p>The Town was fortified with ſeven great Baſtions, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Sabionera, Vetturi, Jeſus, Martinengo, Betlem, Panigra,</hi> and St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> all incompaſſed with a large and deep Ditch, of which were the <hi>Revelin</hi> of <hi>Spiritto,</hi> the <hi>Revelin</hi> of <hi>Panigra</hi> flanked to the right, with the Half-Moon of <hi>Mecenigo,</hi> next thereunto, was the <hi>Revelin</hi> of <hi>Batlem</hi> bordering on the work of St. <hi>Maries,</hi> which to the left had the <hi>Revelin</hi> of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and this joyned to the Fortification of <hi>de Palma,</hi> next whereunto was the <hi>Revelin</hi> of <hi>Priuli,</hi> with the redoubt of <hi>Crepa Cuore,</hi> and over all was the Royal Fort of St. <hi>Demetrio,</hi> which Commanded the work of <hi>Molino,</hi> and <hi>Sabionera,</hi> even to the very Sea.</p>
               <p>Before this formidable place, the Viſier pitched his Tents, raiſed his Battery, and provided all things neceſſary to approach the work, running his Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with great celerity to the border of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, but there met with ſuch blaſts of <hi>Aetnean</hi>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:57574:285"/>Fires from the Mines and Farnellos, that they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the <hi>Turks</hi> Traverſes, and greatly diſincoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, conſidering that if the Ground was unſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure at that diſtance, what Abyſſes and Chaſmas muſt there be prepared to make them Graves under the Walls or enterance of the City, when not to let them breathe, the Chriſtians ſallyed twice on them, making great ſlaughter of ſuch as were far advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the works; when retiring in confuſion, the Collonel of St. <hi>Demetrio</hi> fell upon them, cutting Two Thouſand of them in pieces, e're they could recover their main ſtrength; about which time, Captain General <hi>Moroſini</hi> arrived in the Haven with his Galleys, and put One Thouſand freſh men into the City, which ſo exaſperated the Turks, that they reſolutely advanced to hinder it, but being within danger by the ſpringing of Mines, ſome hundreds of them were ſent to cut capers in the Air; yet the Turks forced by their Commanders like Moles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there working under ground, where many of them dug their own Graves, never more appearing above ground; for being countermined, they were overwhelmed with the blaſts of Powder and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Wild-Fires prepared by <hi>Caſtellan</hi> (the moſt expert Enginere in the World) for that purpoſe, yet the Turks with their ſtink pots, which fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, they threw into the works, ſo infected the Air with noiſom vapours, that long it was e're it could be purged with the burning of <hi>Juniper</hi>-wood, and <hi>Aquavitae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During theſe dayly rancounters, arrived the Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie Galleys from the Pope, and <hi>Malteſians</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Prior <hi>Bichi,</hi> and <hi>Bali Del Bene,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Galleys of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> Commanded by <hi>Gianettino Doria,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Ferandina,</hi> but ſuch was the Cowardiſe of theſe Commanders which
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:57574:285"/>they imputed to, the ſtraitneſs of their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they durſt not come on ſhoar, nor at the inſtance of the Marqueſs <hi>D' Villa,</hi> ſend him ſo much as a man, except ſuch renowned <hi>French</hi> Voluntiers as would enter the City, not being under their Command, amongſt whom was the Cavalier <hi>D' Harcourt,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who did ſingular ſervice by his Valour and Conduct; nor did theſe Galleys ought at Sea, but after ſome time, coaſting the Iſland, ingloriouſly returned home to theirs, and their Maſters Infamy.</p>
               <p>Theſe things happening, the Signior <hi>Giavarina</hi> ſurrendred his charge of Captain of the Galleys to Signeor <hi>Paſquelino,</hi> and by the order of the Senate, went again to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and from thence paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to treat with the Great Viſier about a truce, but nothing would be conſented to, unleſs <hi>Candia</hi> was delivered, whereupon he generouſly ſcorned to treat further, though the Viſier deſired it, and appointed a place for that purpoſe, which ſo inraged him, that he commanded the Mines about <hi>Panigra</hi> to be ſprung, and a furious Aſſault to be given, but it proved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful by the great ſlaughter of the Turks, whoſe bodys filled up the ruines of the Mine.</p>
               <p>At the end of <hi>July</hi> arrived Six Hundred Foot, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Leading of <hi>Ottanio Alba,</hi> a Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> bringing with him likewiſe Twenty Thouſand Ducats, who entring the City, was joyfully recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, during which ſpaces, the Fights between the Miners under Ground, were as bloody as thoſe in the open Field, ſo that the Men ſeemed to make war in the Grave; nor were the Turks ſlow in placing their Mines to advantage, eſpecially one, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Fire, blew up part of the Half-Moon, leaving thereby a paſſage Twelve Foot wide, at which the Turks preſſing to enter, were miſerably overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:57574:286"/>by the ſtorms of ſhot that flew like Hail from the Flankers, whereupon the better to make their approaches, the Turks filled ſacks of Earth, and planted them near the Walls, which the Chriſtians with long Iron hooks drew away, and left them open to the fury of Muſquitiers, who were the more incouraged by another ſupply of Five Hundred <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> under the Command of Signeour <hi>D' Riva,</hi> when on the Fifteenth of <hi>September,</hi> the Chriſtians ſallyed, and after a hot skirmiſh, trained the Turk into the danger of a Mine, which being ſprung, ſent Three Hundred of them into the Air, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Fight very bloody and doubtful, till at length the Chriſtians retired under the Baſtion of <hi>Betlem,</hi> and the Turks with the ſhot from thence were beaten off.</p>
               <p>On the Eighteenth they made another ſalley, and trained the Turks into the danger of another Mine, though not without ſome loſs of their own; their Captain being wounded, and Ten or Twelve of them ſlain, yet they again ſallyed, and ſprung ſeveral Mines to the deſtroying of Six Thouſand Turks, whilſt the Enginere framed an Engine to rid the Ditch of the Earth that the Mines had thrown into it, but the Turks undermining where it ſtood, blew it into the Air, yet the Labourers with Baskets and Sacks ſupplyed its place; and on the Twentieth of <hi>October,</hi> a Mine of Forty Barrels of Powder was fired by the Chriſtians to deſtroy the Enemies redoubts, but on the contrary, it burſt through an old Gallery with ſuch force, as made the City tremble, as if an Earthquake had happened, and with the confuſed ſmoak ſtifled about Sixty Men.</p>
               <p>About this time, the Grand Signior ſent an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to the Viſier, to ſend him an exact account how the ſiege was carryed on, and what hopes there was
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:57574:286"/>of winning the piece, ſending him a Sword, and a veſt of Sables as a token of his favour; to merit which, and that the Grand Signiors Inquiſitor might be a Spectator of the difficulty in winning the place, he commanded a General aſſault the next day ſhould be made upon <hi>Panigra,</hi> which was carryed on with ſuch deſperateneſs, that the Turks entered the Ditches, but were ſoon diſlodged by the Springing Mines, which made them ſpraul by Hundreds in the Air, and overthrew many of the Enemies redoubts, yet the Viſier not ſatisfied with threats and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, obliged them to renew the Aſſault, which they did with ſuch eagerneſs, in hopes of great rewards, that notwithſtanding the undaunted courage of the Defendants, <hi>Panigra</hi> had been taken, had not the General given order for the blowing it up, which was done with ſuch a Thunder-crack from the breath of Seventy Barrels of Powder under a huge pile of ſtones, that the Turks Camp trembled, and in it periſhed Three Thouſand Turks, amongſt whom were Three Baſſas, and many other of note. This for the preſent aſtoniſhed the Turks, and gave a ſtop to the further proceedings of this Aſſault. This proof gave evident Conviction to the Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors Inquiſitor of the ſtrength of the place, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of the work; and having been an Eye-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of what had paſſed, returned with diſmal ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of a cruel War, reporting (perhaps) and it was related in moſt parts of Chriſtendom, that this was the place where blood was ſpilt day and night, where Gallant Men had forgot to ſleep, living in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual labours, innur'd to intolerable ſufferings, and hourly dangers, there being none ſecure in Church, Houſe, or Street; for Granadoes ſpouted f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1668. in the month of <hi>March</hi> a ſharp ingagement happened between ſixteen <hi>Venetian,</hi> and twelve Turkiſh Gallies, the latter not expecting ſuch a number in thoſe, tho indeed they had been ſent to ſurprize yet entering into a ſharp diſpute ſix of the Turks Gallies were ſunk or taken, and the reſt much ſhattered eſcaped under the ſhelter of the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:57574:287"/>night, having loſt moſt of their Souldiers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and ſoon after the Captain General of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> lighting accidentally of ſix other Turkiſh Gallies took and ſunk them all ſave one that run her ſelf on ſhoar.</p>
               <p>Spring being now come the Turks began to creep out of their Trenches, having raiſed a Fort on the ſide of the <hi>Lazaretto,</hi> which ſo offended the Port that there was no harbour or acceſs for Veſſels, and the like they had erected on the other ſide near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fort of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> which greatly offended <hi>Tramata</hi> another harbour on the left hand, and in the night paſſing undiſcovered of the Centinels they fixed a ſtrong Cable to the Palliſado of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> and ſtrained it ſo hard with an Engine erected for that purpoſe, that they tore away ſeveral of the main beams, heightned with which ſucceſs they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to advance their Lines on that ſide, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which the General commanded two hundred under the leading of Major <hi>Motta,</hi> to ſally out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, which they effected with ſuch expedition and ſecreſie, that they ſlew a great number of them and put the reſt that were running the Line to flight, overthrowing their redoubts and filling up Lines for which good ſervice the General beſtowed amongſt them fifty Zechins, and commanded the platform to be finiſhed from whence with his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non he greatly annoyed the Enemy, and having deſtroyed ſeveral Redoubts by ſpringing of Mines, ſallyed about eight hundred ſtrong, and made great ſlaughter of the Turks driving them out of their Trenches. Howſoever the Turks with admirable patience crept forward under the ſhelter of their Baſtion, running their Traverſes croſs the Lines till <hi>Maupaſſau</hi> an Engineer by ſpringing ſeveral Mines put a ſtop to their proceedings. But now what

               <p>The new General eſtabliſhed in his place of truſt took a diligent ſurvey of the Forts and Walls of the City, giving ſuch neceſſary orders as he conceived moſt convenient, nor was his diligence without reaſon for the Turks dayly preſſed nearer to the Walls of the City, raiſing many redoubts with ſuch expedition, that they could not be deſtroyed ſo faſt as they were raiſed, though the Miners ceaſed not to uſe their utmoſt diligence, and from them playing with their Cannon many brave men were killed on the Walls, and amongſt the reſt Provide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor General <hi>Nani,</hi> and <hi>Franciſco Bataglia,</hi> Brother to the Duke of <hi>Candia</hi> were ſlain with Muſquet ſhots.</p>
               <p>The long continuance of this ſiege drew thither many Worthies, and amongſt others <hi>Monſier La Fuillade</hi> Duke of <hi>Roanez.</hi> The Count of St. <hi>Pauls.</hi> The Duke <hi>De Carderouſſe.</hi> The Count <hi>D' Villa Maur,</hi> and the Duke <hi>De Chateau Tiery,</hi> who came accompanied with ſix hundred Men moſt of them Gentlemen of note, to try their valour in the field of <hi>Mars,</hi> who like ſo many inraged Lyons by their frequent ſallies killed a great number of the Turks, beating them through their Trenches, and terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them at that rate that they ſcarcely durſt make

               </p>
               <p>This ſlaughter for a while greatly diſcouraged the Turks, but in the end recovering breath, they made a ſtrong aſſault upon one of the Forts of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> and gained it, preſſing on to the Baſtion of <hi>Sabionera</hi> to the Weſt with a force of ten thouſand men hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the advantage of three batteries, each conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of then pieces of Ordinance, and the next night gave a general aſſault with all their Forces to the Baſtions of <hi>Panigra, Sabionera,</hi> and St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the great Fort of St. <hi>Demetrius,</hi> but the beſieged were armed with all caution and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt ſurprize, and with that conduct and

So the Ambaſſador remained at a diſtance till he received orders to paſs over into <hi>Candia,</hi> there to treat with the Viſier, who weary of the tedious ſiege willingly
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:57574:289"/>gave him Audience hoping that he came to treat about a ſurrender of the City, which in any caſe he deſired as fearing notwithſtanding his bravadoes he ſhould be forced to raiſe his ſiege without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, but he only offered <hi>Suda</hi> and a conſiderable ſumme of money, which not redounding to the glory of the Viſier, by reaſon that might have been had ere the War began, he would come to no agreement, for the Ambaſſador inſiſted that <hi>Candia</hi> being main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Armes of Forreign Princes it could not without their conſent be ſurrendered, but that all the reſt of the Iſland ſhould be the reward of their blood and labour, and although the Viſier af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards propoſed in lieu thereof, the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould have free Licence to rebuild <hi>Paleo Caſtro,</hi> yet the final anſwer of the Ambaſſador was, that <hi>Candia</hi> was capable of no conditions but what were impoſed on it by force of Armes.</p>

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:57574:290"/>Turky the Money of all Nations in currant to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain value) they complained to the <hi>Cadies</hi> or chief Judges, who with the conſent of the Grand Seignior, called it into the Mint, allowing no more for it than it was in true value, to the infinite loſs both of Turks and Strangers, and ſoon after the Grand Seignior being greatly fearful that the people growing weary of his Government, might place one of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the Throne, to ſecure any danger that way, ſent an Officer to the Queen-Mother, under whoſe Tuition they were, to demand their heads, and bring them to him at <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> but ſhe upon ſight of his mandate abhorring the Fact, ſecretly gave notice thereof to the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> to whom ſhe had ſworn the protection of the Young Princes, which unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected News blew up ſuch a flame as had like to have turned all into confuſion, and wrote worſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects than any the Grand Seignior had before cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly imagined, but in the end, with large promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and larger Donations, the Tempeſt was alay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Spring approaching, the Turkiſh Army which for the moſt part had layn immured all Winter, twixt the Walls of earth, crept forth as Worms out of the ground, and again began to run their Trenches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Walls of <hi>Candia,</hi> before which Mountains and confuſed heaps of rubbiſh and Mold lay, which had been thrown up by the Mines and Frencellos, which ſo looſned the nerves and pores of the Earth, that all about it ſeemed hollow, inſomuch that light appeared often out of one Mine into another, which gave either ſide frequent opertunities of ſtealing pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out of each others Mines, the Turks like Moles working ſtill underground, ſo that the ſtrongeſt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the World was rather reduced to extremity by ſuch as knew no uſe of any thing, but of the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:57574:290"/>Spade and Mattock, rather than by force of Armes, for many were of opinion that all the Forces of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire could not otherwiſe have taken it, by this means being ſo near advanced that their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes could eaſily be ſlung into the City, they did great miſchief, wounding and killing many of the Prime Commanders, and beating down houſes in abundance, when amongſt the reſt a Cannon ſhot fell into a Magazine of Fireworks, and ſtriking upon a Granado ſhell that was filled with powder fired, that firing about a hundred more, containing thirty bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of powder, which beat down moſt of the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent houſes, and did great hurt to the Gariſon, and on the 28th. of <hi>May</hi> the Turks ſprung 5 Mines in the mouth of the breach they had made on the Fort of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> and preſſed hard to carry it, now weak and almoſt turned into a heap of rubbiſh, which cauſed the Captain General the Marqueſs of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> and all the chief Officers to take up their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on that ſide.</p>

               <p>All things being in a readineſs, the <hi>French</hi> about Two hours before day, in the ſecreteſt manner ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, ſallied at St. <hi>Georges</hi> Gate, the Signal to fall on, being the ſpringing of the Royal Mine, which through the Dampneſs of the Powder, or the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merouſneſs of the Enginiere, took not effect; the General impatient of delay, not ſtaying for the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet of the forlorn-hope, which lay within half Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet ſhot of the Enemy, aſſaulted two redoubts, took them, and put all he found in them to the Sword; with the like courage the other Regiments

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> is ſaid to have laboured much in reſiſting the ſhameful flight of his Men, and ventering his Perſon into danger, from whence he reſolved never ingloriouſly to retreat, was oppreſſed
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57574:292"/>by Numbers, and fighting couragiouſly amongſt the thickeſt of his Enemies, expired on the heaps; but by reaſon his Body, though much ſought after, could not be found; many conjectured him to have periſhed by the fatal blow of Powder, which ſo frighted and diſordered the Chriſtian Army, nor had the <hi>French</hi> Fleet much better ſucceſs; for being driven from ſhoar by a ſtrong Wind, they little or nothing indamaged the Turks, but received conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable dammage for a great Ship of Sixty Braſs Guns blew up, in which Two Hundred Ninety Two pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and her ſhot paſſing through the Admiral, killed ſeveral on board, and indamaged other Ships, by the fall of her Timber and Splinters.</p>
               <p>The Loſs the Turks ſuſtained is uncertain, but however, according to their own report. Eight Thouſand are ſaid to fall in the Trenches, Forts, and Redoubts; the loſs amongſt the <hi>French</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted moſtly in their Nobility and Officers of note, a fate incident to that Nation, the chief of which were the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> Count <hi>Roſan,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>D' Fabert,</hi> the Chevalier <hi>Villereceaux,</hi> and the Chevalier <hi>D' Quelas,</hi> with about Twenty others, all Commanders, and a Thouſand common Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, many of note were likewiſe wounded, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners taken, exceeded not Seven or Eight, the chief of which were the Sieur <hi>D' Bois,</hi> Dauphin Son to a Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> of that Name, and the Sieur <hi>D' Chateau</hi> Neuf the firſt for his youth and beauty, and the ſecond for his courage, being afterwards greatly eſteemed by the Turks, and both entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Viſier with more generoſity than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</p>
               <p>Theſe proceedings ſo amazed and diſcouraged the <hi>French,</hi> that the Duke <hi>D' Navailles,</hi> now their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief, could not be perſwaded to ſtay any

               <p>The <hi>French</hi> thus departed, the Turks took cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and attacqued the quarter of <hi>Sabionera,</hi> and St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> where putting the out-Guards to flight, they advanced to the <hi>Paliſado</hi> of the new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment, but Vollies of Cannon, and ſhowers of Muſquet-ſhot, with quarries of ſtones thrown from the Engines pouring on them, gave a check to their proceedings; but the <hi>Candiots</hi> perceiving, they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the multitudes of the Enemie in vain, with one voice implored the Captain General to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the City that was not Tenable, and not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to the fury of a Mercileſs Enemy, of whom the Marqueſs <hi>D' Montbourn</hi> taking pity, and finding himſelf too weak to oppoſe ſuch powerful Forces as the Turks, by reaſon of new ſupplys had in their Camp, they as it were already having poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the main ſtrengths of the City, he aſſembled a Councel of all the Chief Officers both in the City, and thoſe that belonged to the Fleet, who after a ſerious conſideration, concluded that the City could not by force nor policy be much longer held by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſmall number of the Defendants, and the incroachment of whoſe number was ten to one; whereupon the General was of opinion, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving imbarqued all the unneceſſary people, and thoſe that were wounded, they ſhould by firing of Mines
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:57574:293"/>lay the City waſte, and ſo leave the Enemy a bloody and inglorious Victory, which Noble Reſolution was ſeconded by ſeveral other Chiefs, but in the end it was agreed that a treaty ſhould be had with the Turks about its ſurrender, the which after ſome debates was concluded on theſe Articles.</p>

               <p>What quantities the Turks might conſume of Ammunition is uncertain, but it was obſervable that the Braſs taken up in the ſtreets, which came from their Granadoes and Bombes filled a Warehouſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for that purpoſe, and was afterward ſold for a hundred thouſand Crowns.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe Articles <hi>Candia</hi> was ſurrended the news of which coming to the ears of the Grand Signiour he could not for a while believe it, till he had a further confirmation. Yet the City upon its delivery was ſo ruined, that it ſeemed rather a heap of confuſion, then a place to dwell in, nor did any more then five able perſons, and ſome that were ſo aged and decrepit as were not fit to travel, ſtay in it, ſo that the Turks gained this ſixteen Acres of ground, for no more was that famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in compaſs, with ineſtimable expence of blood and Treaſure; yet the glory and fame which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it being the conſummation of five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, of which the laſt ſiege laſted two years, nine months, and ſeven and twenty dayes, was of greater value to the Turks, then any other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and may with time prove a place of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the further increaſe of their Weſtern Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, unleſs the Almighty give a ſtop to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of their Arms.</p>
               <p>The News of <hi>Candia</hi>'s ſurrender being publiſhed greatly rejoyced the Turk, who groaned under the Taxations levyed for the maintenance of that War, as likewiſe ridded the Grand Signeour of a great part of his care inſomuch that he gave himſelf on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Hunting and dalliance with his <hi>Sultana,</hi> who had born him the firſt Son, of whom he became ſo inamoured that he ſlighted all his other Women,

               <p>The Viſier paſſing from <hi>Scio</hi> ſailed to <hi>Rodeſto,</hi> and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:57574:296"/>from thence to <hi>Adrinople,</hi> where he was received in a manner of Triumph by the Grand Signeour, who expreſſed the more then ordinary ſatisfaction he conceived not only in the conduct of his affaires, but that he was ſafely returned from a tedious and bloody War.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of the following year the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Ambaſſador arrived at the Port, to ſettle and confirm the Treaty, as to the eſtabliſhing the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers in <hi>Dalmatia, Albania,</hi> and other parts of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Territories, in which there aroſe ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes between the borderers on either ſide, that ſome skirmiſhes happened after the Articles of <hi>Candia</hi> were ſubſcribed; The Ambaſſador being introduced with all due ceremonies, complained of ſeveral outrages done to the Subjects of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whereupon commiſſioners on either part were appointed to meet between <hi>Climno</hi> and <hi>Cliſſa,</hi> to adjuſt matters as they ſaw convenient, but ſuch was the fury of the people that without regard to the honour of the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neour or the Senate, they ſeized upon ſeveral places which they alledged to be their peculiar Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſwearing that no peace made to the advantage of their Superiours ſhould exclude them their right, but in the end the Turks who were the chief Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors were put to flight by a power of <hi>Venetians</hi> ſent for that purpoſe, and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſuph Bey</hi> their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and chief perſwader to the infringement of the Peace was ſlain, after which the Commiſſions were granted and made more ample then formerly, for determining the right of the Signory and Empire on the confines of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and other Countries adjoyning, and on the 27th. of <hi>July,</hi> conferring in a Tent ſet up for that purpoſe, after much debate many boundards were affixed, but that which was moſt inſiſted on, was <hi>Verpogly</hi> a ſmall Fortreſs on
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:57574:296"/>the top of a Hill once belonging to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> which at the beginning of the War they abandoned, as coſting more to maintain or defend, then the value or conſideration of it, which the Turks poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing averred it to be theirs by the Law of Arms, arguing ſtrongly, that any other Nation might have ſeized on it to the prejudice both of the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and the Subjects of the Grand Signeour. Theſe debates had like to have created new Hoſtilities, but <hi>Mamut</hi> Baſſa dying in the middle of the Treaty, and <hi>Chuſaien</hi> Baſſa commiſſioned in his ſtead, who was of a milder and more flexible temper, difficulties that obſtructed a concluſion were removed, and on the 24th. of <hi>October,</hi> 1671. in open <hi>Divan</hi> held in the <hi>Campaigne</hi> of <hi>Salona</hi> all things were concluded, and Coppies of the Agreement ſubſcribed and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably given. And in this manner the difference about the confines were concluded, and the long War between the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Turks ended.</p>
               <p>About this time a Turkiſh Envoy ſent to the French Court returned, bringing with him an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador from the King called <hi>Monſieur de Nointel,</hi> who with three Men of War and a Fireſhip ſailing through the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and coaſting along the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontis</hi> refuſing to ſalute the <hi>Seraglio</hi> unleſs he was firſt ſaluted, a nicety not required by any Ambaſſador before him, which not being granted lay off at Sea, as being refuſed by the Officers of the City as Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, but in the end the Viſier prudently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that for a meer punctilio it was not coveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nor ſafe to exaſperate the French Nation, nor thereon to ground a War, whereupon he gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he ſhould be received with the uſual Ceremony, and conducted to his Audience, nor was the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the French Souldiers and Sailors who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many ourages on the Coaſt taken notice of,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:57574:297"/>or if they were it was ſo that they were diſſembled, and although whilſt the Ships lay before the City a hundred ſlaves from on board the Turks Gallies, and out of the City eſcaped by getting on board and amongſt them <hi>Monſieur de Peau-jeu</hi> a Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> yet that was likewiſe diſſembled, and not thought a ſufficient ground for War with a Nation whoſe valour the Turks by fatal experience had tryed, but in the end the French became more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and new inſtructions being brought the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador by a man of War, he paſſed to <hi>Adrinople</hi> where the Grand Signeour was gone, and having his ſecond Audience granted, his firſt being had of the Viſier, he deſired that the League ſo long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued between his Maſter and the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes might continue, and that the capitulation might be renewed only with the Alteration of the cuſtoms, impoſed upon his Maſters Subjects from five to three in the hundred according to that priviledge which the Engliſh and other Chriſtian Merchants, whoſe league and Friendſhip was ſubſequent to theirs, but after many delays the Viſier would not accord, but referred him to his return from the Wars of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> on which he was intent, which diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment greatly perplexed the Ambaſſador.</p>
               <p>The Grand Signeour having before miſſed his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in making away his Brethren for fear of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> now in their abſence moſt of them being buſied in the Wars, renewed his reſolution and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of Friendſhip poiſoned <hi>Orcham</hi> the Eldeſt with a bowl of Wine, though ſome affirm he was ſtrangled with a Bow ſtring, and that ere he fell he killed one of the Executioners, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it happened he was made away, whoſe death once known greatly incenſed the people againſt the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:57574:297"/>Grand Signior, and prevented the like effects on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Brother. All other matters now layed aſide about the beginning of the year 1672. preparations were made for the Poliſh War though with ſuch deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as expreſſed an unwillingneſs thereto on the part of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> who having experienced the force of that warlike Nation moved thereto with caution. Yet their motives were not inconſiderable, but ſuch as thereon a War might be grounded not only for the continual Piracy of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> on the Black Sea, and their aſſiſting the bordering Princes in their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Turkiſh Arms, and the little regard the Poliſh Ambaſſador had of the Port treating there with equal grandure, and aſſuming a Liberty above the Miniſters of other Chriſtian Princes, and now they lay more open to be aſſaulted by reaſon of the diviſions amongſt themſelves, whereby an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offered to the Grand Signeour to oblige the <hi>Polonians</hi> to a complyance of his demands, yet whilſt preparatians were making on all hands an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador was ſent to the Viſier, he advancing with his Army towards the frontires named <hi>Wiſozski,</hi> a Noble man of <hi>Poland</hi> preſuming upon his Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity argued after ſuch a lofty manner, and in terms ſo contrary to the methods of an Ambaſſador, that the Viſier much incenſed diſpatched a <hi>Chiaus</hi> into <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with Letters, deſiring that this Ambaſſador might be recalled as being a perſon unable to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage matters of the leaſt concernment, inſinuating that if they ſupplyed his place with another he ſhould be received with due reſpect, and a plain way laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pento conclude his Negotiations to the ſatisfaction of both parties. Upon notice of which the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador was ſo ſenſibly touched that he in a rage ſent Letters to the aſſembly of the Poliſh Nobility to certifie them that he was not only debarred of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance uſual to Ambaſſadors but alſo was impriſoned,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:57574:298"/>both of which (though untrue, for the former he refuſed as too little for one o0f his Character, and the latter being onely his confinement to the City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by reaſon of ſome outrages his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants committed at his houſe at <hi>Pera</hi>) being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved kindled ſuch a flame that the <hi>Poles</hi> impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Turkiſh <hi>Chiaus,</hi> and ordered that all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey ſhould be put in Arms rendering the Viſier no other anſwer then that when their Ambaſſador was ſet at Liberty and had Licenſe to depart, the like ſhould be done to theirs. Of theſe proceedings the Grand Signeour having notice was highly offended immediately ordering that <hi>Wiſoski</hi> ſhould depart, and at the ſame time commanded his whole Militia to riſe and follow him to the Wars, fending a Sword and Veſt to the <hi>Tartar Han</hi> with orders to unite his Forces with the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> that had revolted from the <hi>Poles,</hi> and ſpeedily to invade <hi>Polonia,</hi> which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he did and incountering near <hi>Batowa</hi> with a Body of <hi>Poliſh</hi> Horſe, under the command of <hi>Luzecki</hi> Governour of <hi>Podolia</hi> he overthrew them, which was the firſt bad Omen of the ill ſucceſs of this unhappy War.</p>
               <p>The Grand Signeour having raiſed an Army of one hundred fifty thouſand men marched towards <hi>Poland</hi> already ſick and languiſhing with its own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine diſtempers, and unable to contend with a body united within it ſelf. The firſt enterprize he made was upon impregnable Fortreſs of the <hi>Caminieck</hi> which had ſo often baffled the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Force, but now being weakly manned unprovided of all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and deſpairing of Relief, after fourteen days ſiege ſurrendered, the Garriſon in it ſubmitting to the will of the Conqueror, which opened a paſſage through all <hi>Podolia</hi> and <hi>Volhinia</hi> to the very Walls of <hi>Leopolis,</hi> which they paſſed over rather like Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers

Yet ſuch was the command of the Grand Signeour, that no Souldier ſpoiled or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged any perſon, which ſo far won upon the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the <hi>Polonians</hi> that they in all places where he paſſed ſubmitted, and put themſelves under his protection, which ſo awakened the Nobility, that a Council being called it was reſolved that to buy their Peace, and be ſhut of theſe new come gueſts.</p>

               <p>Theſe Articles being ſigned the Grand Signeour committed the Government of <hi>Veravia,</hi> and <hi>Podolia</hi> to <hi>Doroſensko</hi> General of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> and the defence of <hi>Cominieck</hi> and <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Baſſa, with a Garriſon of twelve thouſand <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and ſo returned to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> diſmiſſing the greateſt part of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, poor and almoſt naked by reaſon of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtrained from plundering.</p>

               <p>The League the Poles made with the Turk was not long obſerved, for after they had recollected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being aſhamed of ſuch inglorious conditions, dealt with the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> to revolt from <hi>Doroſensko,</hi> who had ingaged them in the Grand Signeours intereſt, which put all again into hazard and confuſion, ſo that the Grand Signeour was obliged to give over his paſtimes, and betake himſelf to Armes, nor was the unexpected news of the loſs of the <hi>Alexandian</hi> Fleet, taken by the Gallies of <hi>Malta</hi> and <hi>Coriſaries</hi> of <hi>Legorn</hi> leſs unwelcome news.</p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:57574:299"/>
               <p>The <hi>Poles</hi> incouraged by the motion of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> notwithſtanding the Articles, refuſed to pay the Tribute agreed on, which by their Ambaſſador they certified the Grand Signeours Miniſters, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to have it waved, but the Turk ſurprized there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at more earneſtly demanded it, though at firſt many fair words were uſed but they not prevailing the Grand Signeour gave order for all his Forces to be in a readineſs, hanging out the Tough or Horſes tail, and ordering his Tents to be pitched in the Field, &amp; the more to frighten them ſent a Letter filled with dreadful menaces agreeable to the Turkiſh ſtile, which threatened them with confuſion, Sword, Famine, Fire, deſtruction and a thouſand other direful puniſhments. Yet was not ſo forward, for though his Army was imbodied yet that Summer they only paſſed the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubius,</hi> and the enſuing Winter quartered about <hi>Siliſtria,</hi> that they may terrifie the <hi>Poles</hi> the more with their approach, and for the diverting the French Kings Arms from being ſerviceable to the Poles, his Ambaſſador received ſatisfaction in what he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to the leſſening the cuſtoms and allowance of Jeſuits and Religious Houſes in <hi>Juruſalem, Galatia</hi> and other parts of the Turkiſh Dominions, and that in all reſpects the ſubjects of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty ſhould be every where well intreated, throughout the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, after which the Ambaſſador obtained a licenſe to travel and take a view of the Countrey, when in the mean while the Poliſh Army to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 20000 horſe and foot were advancing from the Walls of <hi>Leopolis</hi> under the command of General <hi>Sobieski,</hi> and <hi>Zircha</hi> made General of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> in the room of <hi>Dorisensko,</hi> joyning with a party of <hi>Maſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> and <hi>Calmuck Tartars,</hi> made incurſions into the parts about <hi>Oſac,</hi> the news of which ſo amazed the Grand Signiour that he put off his intended march to

               <p>The Grand Seigniors forwardneſs was not ſo great, but that the <hi>Poles</hi> were as earneſt as he, and little regarding his Menaces reſolved to be the firſt Agreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; For General <hi>Sobieskie</hi> having increaſed his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the number of Fifty Thouſand, boldly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Nieſter,</hi> to whom ſoon after revolted the Prince, or Vayvod of <hi>Moldavia</hi> with certain Troops of Horſe and Foot, for that the Baſſa <hi>Chuſaein</hi> had reproached him, and at the head of his Troops ſtruck him with his Battle Axe, and the Prince of <hi>Valachia</hi> was forced into the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Camp by his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, but he ſoon after made his eſcape, and was by the Grand Seignior received into favour.</p>

               <p>This victory thus happily obtained, the ſtrong Fortreſs of <hi>Chotin</hi> was ſurrender'd to the <hi>Poles,</hi> and many other places of leſs importance, for the loſs of which, and the overthrow of his Army, the Grand Seignior was ſo highly diſpleaſed with <hi>Chuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ein</hi> Baſſa, that he cauſed him to be impriſoned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of all his Eſtate and Honours, and cauſed him to be layed in chains, denying him the uſe of Phyſitians, or any others, unleſs ſuch attendants as brought him neceſſaries, and thus was this proud Baſſa, who but a while before Lorded it over Princes, plunged into the depth of miſery.</p>
               <p>The joy of this great victory that had ſo elevated the <hi>Poles,</hi> was ſoon damped upon the death of their King, who departing at a juncture, when the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my who by this time had recruited, was at hand with a powerful Army, and the Nation not well ſettled cauſed divers fears in the people, yet the Army not to be idle divided into divers parties, and in the depth of Winter, a time wherein they well knew the Turks would not travel, entered <hi>Moldavia,</hi> blocked up <hi>Keminitz,</hi> and brought away great booties, ſpoiling all in their way, till ſuch time as the Spring coming on, the Turks with multitudes came againſt them, and obliged them to retire, at whiat time the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:57574:301"/>committed divers outrages upon their Frontiers, carrying away much People and Cattle, burning and deſtroying all before them, the which though it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed the <hi>Tartar Han,</hi> yet feigning himſelf ſick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome diſpleaſure received, he refuſed to take the field in perſon, though the Grand Seignior had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, yet that that might not obſtruct the progreſs of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Armes, the Great Viſier ſent him his own Phyſitian, an <hi>Italian</hi> of great experience, who found him overwhelmed with deep Melancholly, but with Cordials and Medicaments ſoon raiſed him to his former vivacity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Keminitz</hi> all this while blocked up, was by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Turkiſh Army relieved, which the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier perceiving, cauſed his Troops to March to <hi>Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ozim</hi> a ſtrong Fortreſs taken by the Chriſtians upon the defeat of <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Baſſa, which was retaken, and the Garriſon contrary to Articles put to the Sword, nor durſt the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> who were far advanced op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Forces, but retired before them, leaving <hi>Aſac</hi> diſmantled and plundered, which the Turks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built and fortified.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Mahomet</hi> Baſſa being made at the inſtance of his Favourites Captain of a Squadron of Gallies, plundered and haraſſed moſt of the Iſlands in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> which raiſed ſuch hatred againſt him, and the loud complaints of the people being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> before him, he at his return had his head ſtricken off, and all his ill gotten gains confiſcated; So that like an <hi>Indian</hi> Cormorant, which being made tame, and taught to fiſh for the benefit of his Maſter, he was prevented from ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the prey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hungary</hi> being torn with civil diſſentions, the Male-contents deſirous to throw off the <hi>German</hi> yoke ſent to the Port, deſiring to be taken into the Grand
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:57574:301"/>Seigniors protection, and to become his Tributaries, which made the Turks haſten to ſettle their affairs, that they might be the better at leaſure to take the advantage of thoſe inteſtine troubles, for the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the reſt of that ſpacious Kingdom to the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> obedience, and the better to ſecure his new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, he removed a part of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> with all their ſubſtance to the banks of the Black Sea, there aſſigning them Lands, and as for the <hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> that dwelt in <hi>Reminitz,</hi> he tranſplanted them to <hi>Philopolis, Adrinople</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> giving the youngeſt and luſtieſt of either Sex as a prey to his Souldiers, who ſold them for ſlaves throughout the Turkiſh Empire, and then returning with his Army to <hi>Adrinople,</hi> there to watch all advantages, he ſoon after disbandoned part of his <hi>Aſian</hi> horſe as charga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and troubleſom, but whilſt theſe projects in State were broaching, great differences aroſe between the Latin and Greek Church about the poſſeſſion of the Holy Sepulchre at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which had been ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by thoſe of the Roman Catholick Religion for many years, but now at the inſtance of <hi>Panajoti</hi> the Viſiers Interpreter a zealous Greek, the latter were preferred, and after a long controverſie and much Money ſpent, the Greek obliged the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in thoſe parts to pay them tribute for ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces relating to Religion they there held, every Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er paying a dram of Silver yearly to the Patriarch; So that now the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have poſſeſſion neither of the Chappel of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> nor of the Sepulchre; The former of which had of a long time held, and the latter as earneſtly contended for.</p>
               <p>The Grand Seignior not unmindful of the affairs of <hi>Hungary,</hi> gave order to the Baſſas on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires, ſecretly to incourage the Diviſion till ſuch time as he ſhould be at leaſure to imploy his Armes on that
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:57574:302"/>ſide, hoping that an accommodation with <hi>Poland</hi> would inſue, but found not the <hi>Poles</hi> ſo forward therein as he expected, for the Wars ſtill continued though not with ſuch violence as before, which gave the Grand Seignior leave to Solemnize the Marriage of his Daughter with <hi>Rul-ogli,</hi> (which in the Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Language ſignifies the Son of a ſlave) who was his great Favourite and Baſſa of <hi>Magneſia,</hi> as alſo to Circumciſe his Son, the former being 17 years of Age, and the latter 12, to ſolemnize which, the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals were appointed on the 16th. of <hi>May, Anno</hi> 1675. when in the Morning the Grand Seignior with the young Prince his Son went to their Tents, which were pitched in a Plain before the City exceeding rich, round which all the great men of the Court had their Pavilions placed, amongſt which was raiſed a ſtately Throne covered with a Canopy of Cloath of Gold, placed beneath the umbrage of two Elmes, which ſhining with many Lamps in the night made a glorious ſhew, and in this Seat of State the <hi>Sultan</hi> placed himſelf in the Morning, being accompanyed thither by all the Baſſa's then reſiding at <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and by the repreſentatives of thoſe that were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, who according to their degrees kiſſed his Robe, and in ſilken Purſes deliver a note of what Preſents they had brought, which were put into the hands of the Treaſurer to ſee them duly received, oppoſite to the Tents were ſeveral Poles fixed, on which by night many Lamps were hung, giving a glorious Light, by which were exerciſed ſeveral tricks of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, as Wreſtling, Dauncing, Singing and Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Fireworks there were in abundance, but not effectually made; The Night being paſſed, in the Morning the ſeveral Trades paſſed before the Tents one after another, every one making their Preſents, and bearing Pageants, Muſick all the while ſounding,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:57574:302"/>after whom came a Cavilcade of all the chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and amongſt them the young Prince flaming with Diamonds, Rubies, and other precious Stones, and before them paſſed Twenty Four ſmall Nachils or Pageants, and two large, one higher than any Ship-Maſt, ſupported by a Hundred Slaves, and were afterward ſet before the Seraglio. On the <hi>27th.</hi> being <hi>Mahomet</hi> their Impoſtor Prophets birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the Grand Signior went publickly to the <hi>Moſch</hi> of <hi>Sultan Selim,</hi> with no other Attendance than thoſe of his own Court, his Pages richly clad in Cloath of Gold, carryed each a Feather ſtudded with Jewels of great value; after the Grand Signior rode the young Prince, who that night was circumciſed: During this Feſtival, a great number of people had their Proviſion at the expence of the Grand Signior, and about Two Thouſand being at that time cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, every one of them had a Quilt given him with a Penſion of three Aſpers a day for Life.</p>
               <p>The Solemnity of the Circumciſion ended, the Feſtival for the Marriage of <hi>Rul-Ogli</hi> with the young Princeſs, which Ceremony in forme and manner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Turkiſh faſhion was thus, The <hi>Kuz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier Aga</hi> or Black Eunuch of the Women was Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom or Compere to the Princeſs, and the Lord Treaſurer to <hi>Rul-Ogli,</hi> both which in the Name of the Bridegroom and Bride went before the <hi>Kedeleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> or Chief Judge, who wrote the Articles of Marriage, and paſſed them into an Act, which done, the Preſents were ſent, and firſt thoſe from the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom to the Bride, which were a great number of Beaſts and Birds made in Sugar, Thirty Mules laden with two Cheſts of Sweet-Meats a piece, and about each of their necks a Sattin Veſt for the Muliter; after them went ſeveral men, carrying Pots of Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, or Water and Sugar boiled, which the Turks
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:57574:303"/>for the moſt part drink; next, a Hundred men car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Veſts of Silk, Sattin, Velvit, and Cloath of Gold, then five Horſes laden with rich Furniture, followed by men, bearing Cloath of Gold Veſts, with ſable Loops richer than the former, for the Loops and Buttons were imbroidered with rich Pearl, and on the top of each were a Rubie Diamond, or Saphier: Theſe likewiſe carryed Shoos, Boots, and Pattens for the Bagneo, all covered with Pearl, as likewiſe two dreſſing Boxes with Chryſtal Glaſſes, and a Cap in form of a Crown, a little Cabinet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered all over with Pearl, Eight Girdles ſet with Emraulds, Rubies, and Diamonds, a large Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Ring, a pair of Pendants of two great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds, with many other things of value.</p>
               <p>Theſe Preſents ſent by the Bride-groom, the Grand Signiour, as his Daughters Dowry, according to the cuſtom of the Eaſtern Countreys, uſhered with a Caval-Cade of all the Grandees ſent to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms-houſe, two Gardens made of Sugar, Forty little Nachils, Eighty Six Mules laden with rich Furniture for a Houſe, Ten Men with dreſſings, as Boots, Shoes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Imbroidered with Pearl and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Stones, after them were carryed the Jewels ſet on Girdles, Bracelets, and the like; then came Twelve Coaches laden with Slaves, and Thirty Six Black Eunuchs, theſe were ſucceeded by a Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade, in which was the Bride riding in a Coach co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Plates of Silver, and drawn by ſix Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the ſides adorned with Golden ſtreams; before which, went the chief Eunuch of the Women, after followed four Coaches with ſix Horſes a piece, each carrying two Eunuchs; ſome diſtance from them, came the Brides Mother in a Coach covered with Plates of Silver, attended by Ten other Coaches; the night following, the Bride was conducted to the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:57574:303"/>Nuptial Chamber, in Ceremony only as not being yet ripe for conſummation of Marriage, though in <hi>England</hi> of late, the Virgins think themſelves wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſtay to her Age unmarried.</p>
               <p>The Ceremony thus performed, great was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing demonſtrated by Fire-works, Shews, and ſounding of Muſical Inſtruments; After which, the Grand Signiour on ſome private conſiderations, though to the wonder of the whole Court, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the great Treaſurer to the Baſſa-ſhip of Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> and appointed the Efendi, or Judge-Advocate of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> to ſucceed him in the Office of Treaſurer; and now the publick Treaſury by the late Wars, and coſtly Ceremonies being almoſt emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, divers ways were uſed to recrute it with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſome was procured by the Sale of great pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from which thoſe that would not largely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, were thruſt, and ſome again extorted from the poorer ſort, whilſt to ſave charges the <hi>Seden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> Millitia was abridged in their penſions, and ſome utterly caſt off, ſo that in a while, a great maſs of Money was heaped together, and Forces ſent to the Frontires of <hi>Poland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time the Republique of <hi>Genoa</hi>'s reſident at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for want of that due Income that was expected to accrue by Trade, contracting large Debts, and having ſeveral debts contracted by his Predeceſſors deceaſed, contracted likewiſe with the Turks of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> a great Man of War that brought him thither, upon the Republique refuſing to pay, was ſeized, and layed up in the Arſenal, nor could a releaſe be procured, till Thirty Three Thouſand Dollars, part of the contracted Debt was payed and ſecured, which ſo diſcouraged the <hi>Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,</hi> that it has ever ſince damped their Trade in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Dominions, and now the Grand Signe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:57574:304"/>moved by chief Cuſtomer reſident at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Eye upon that Scale of Trade, brought him in great Revenues by way of Cuſtom; the better to beautifie it, and reſtore its antient Luſtre, built a Baſaſteen or Exchange, as likewiſe a Cuſtom-Houſe Erected on Piles in the Sea, ſending his abſolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that all Merchants Ships ſhould there unlade, and make due enteries, which greatly perplexed the Merchants, who before were wont to land their Goods on their own Keys, but in vain was their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, for the Grand Signiour would not admit of any reverſal, but by his <hi>Ralya</hi> declared that rather than he would be diſobeyed in his own Dominions, he would blow up the Port and Town, upon which anſwer the Merchants deſpairing of ſucceſs, were content to unlade their Ships at the Cuſtom-Houſe, or there to make a true Entery of the Goods in their Boats; for the Cuſtomer being ſenſible that there was not water enough for the Ships to ride at the Key, was content to diſpenſe with divers matters that the Innovation might ſit more eaſie on the Merchants.</p>
               <p>Things being at this paſs, the Grand Signior after ſixteen years abſence from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which had rendered that City almoſt diſpeopled, returned thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the great Joy of the <hi>Conſtantinopolitans,</hi> and frequently took his pleaſure on the River in his Barge, or on the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> in his Galley, ſtrictly commanding that no Chriſtian Miniſter ſhould be ſuffered to dwell upon the Banks of the latter, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition never before made by any of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, when ſoon after his arrival, the Captain Baſſa dyed, and <hi>Zayd Ahmet</hi> Baſſa <hi>Ogli</hi> ſucceeded him, and ſoon after <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> Baſſa General of the Forees on the Borders of <hi>Poland</hi> dyed, nor was the great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier far from the Brink of the Grave, by reaſon of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:57574:304"/>his immoderate drinking of Wine and Strong-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which made him incident to the Dropſie and Jaundice.</p>
               <p>The new Baſſa of <hi>Cairo</hi> by this time having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on his Office, uſed great diligence to ſettle the Revenues of that Kingdom, hoping thereby to pleaſe the Grand Signior, of whoſe favour ſince his remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val from Treaſurer, he ſtood doubtful, but ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere he was in his Exaction, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> not accuſtomed to be ſo uſed, complained of his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour to the Begs or great Lords of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who though they receive the Turkiſh Baſſas, pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and own them their chief Governours, yet are They in themſelves Abſolute Lords in their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Provinces; for that Kingdom is rather an Ariſtocracy, than a Monarchy. Theſe great Men much diſpleaſed at the proceeding of the Baſſa, which tended to Tyranny and Oppreſſion, took up Arms, and drew after them a great multitude, with which they aſſaulted the Baſſa's palace, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and dragging him thence, caſt him into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which news flying with all haſte to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court, filled all with fear and confuſion, upon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion that <hi>Egypt</hi> was revolted; but a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the truth of the matter being rightly underſtood, the Grand Signior with all ſpeed ſent a new Baſſa with gentle Letters to pacifie the Begs, and reſtore things to their former tranquility; promiſing that reſtitution ſhould be made for all injuries ſuſtained, which meſſage of Grace and Favour made all former diſcontents vaniſh, and reſtored a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, inſomuch, that the impriſoned Baſſa was ſet at Liberty, and ſhipped to <hi>Candia,</hi> where the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niour had appointed him Governour; the people without any further diſturbance returning to their obedience.</p>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:57574:305"/>
               <p>About this time happened the unfortunate fall of <hi>Cheſine Aga,</hi> a man of great repute amongſt the Turks, which was after this manner, a woman cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sultana Sporche,</hi> with which Sultan <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had had to do with her in her youth; being now turned Baud, bought many beautiful Female Slaves, which ſhe brought up to Singing, Dancing, and many other Exerciſes, and then for money, yielded them up to the Luſt of the Great Men of the Court; one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which for her Wit and Beauty being greatly famed, the Grand Signior ſent for her, but the Sultana fearing to looſe her, by whom ſhe got dayly gain, and doubting the Grand Signiour would put her into his Seraglio, admoniſhed her to a ſullen coyneſs, as likewiſe to declare that ſhe was a free-woman, which by the Turkiſh Law ought not to be defiled, nor carnally know any man, unleſs ſhe be married; which part ſhe played ſo well, that the Grand Signior ſent her back with diſdain and reproach to her Miſtreſs, who was not a little glad of her eſcape; but ſo it happened, that the aforeſaid <hi>Aga</hi> ſoon after caſting his Eyes on her, and deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with her quaint Diſcourſe, fell inamour'd with her, and treated of Marriage, which the Wench highly approved, but her Miſtreſs would in no wiſe conſent to it, declaring that ſhe was her Bond-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and not at her own diſpoſal, which for a time put a ſtop to the proceedings; but ſoon after the Lover contrived away to bring their deſigns to paſs, for the <hi>Aga</hi> having taken her private Lodgings, ſhe under the ſhelter of the night made her eſcape, but upon her being miſſed, her Beldame charged him with conveying away, and concealing her ſlave, which he for a while denyed; but ſhe ſetting many ſpies over him, at length found them together, and charging an Officer with them, cauſed them to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:57574:305"/>before the Great Viſier, who ſent to the Grand Signior to know his pleaſure therein, of which the <hi>Aga</hi> having ſome miſtruſt, told the Viſier that he expected no other ſentence then that of Death from the Grand Signior, only he deſired that his beloved Miſtreſs might be ſpared, for he was ſure he ſhould live in her; nor were his fears in vain, for ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came a fatal Decree for his Execution, and ſent the Woman to the Seraglio This cruelty of the Sultans as moſt conjectur'd, proceeded from the diſdain, he conceived that the Wench ſhould refuſe his proffered kindneſs, and imbrace the love of his Slave, for ſuch the Sultans account the greateſt men in the Empire.</p>
               <p>The Grand Signior having ſpent moſt part of the Winter at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> early in the Spring retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Adrinople,</hi> though the better to comfort the <hi>Conſtantinopolitans,</hi> who by reaſon of the ſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Trade that muſt thereon inſue, mourned his abſence; he preſumed about Autumn to return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and for his reception cauſed a new Seraglio to be founded, and ſo ſetting forward, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a great train of Nobility, and amongſt the reſt, the great Viſier, he marched towards <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> but by the way the Viſier dyed, having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed himſelf by intemperate drinking Wine and Hot Spirits, his Body accompanied with a ſlender Train, was brought back to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and there buryed in the Sepulchre of Old <hi>Ruperlee</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The Great Viſier dead, the Seal was given to <hi>Kara Muſtapha,</hi> Baſſa, who for many years had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed the Office of <hi>Chimacam,</hi> or Deputy to the Great Viſier, being a Man of courteous behaviour, wiſe and affable, not given to Covetouſneſs nor Cruelty, but as ſoon as he was promoted, he ſent to
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:57574:306"/>the deceaſed Viſiers Servants to condole the Death of their Maſter, promiſing them to take them into his care and protection; moſt of which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards promoted to Honourable places, to ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that by their dependency on him, they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured both him and themſelves from the malice of ſuch as envyed the advancement: Long he had not been ſetled in his place, e're he cut off the Chief Pay-Maſters head for bringing falſe Money into the Exchequer, and had given another the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, had not his Life been redeemed at Forty Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Money, or Twenty Thouſand Dollars, though thereby his place was not regained, nor was dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence leſs in looking after the corruption of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State, diſplacing and depoſing all ſuch as he ſound remiſs in their duty, or that for lucre or gains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake oppreſſed any of the Grand Signiours Subjects, or ſuch ſtrangers as traded in any part of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p>But by the Example of this man it may be ſeen how Power and Greatneſs can alter the diſpoſition of Men, and make them ſwell with Pride almoſt to burſting, for finding the Reins on his neck, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſtraint, he took upon him the Power and Office of the Sultan, it being more difficult to gain acceſs to him, than to the <hi>Sultan</hi> himſelf, and in imitation of their Maſter, the ſub-Officers grew proud and inſolent; inſomuch, that the face of things, contrary to moſt mens expectations were changed; and this haughty behaviour was ſhewed eſpecially towards forraign Miniſters, whoſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters were not admitted as formerly to private Audiences or Conferences about their Affairs, but only at the publick Divan where their Arzes or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials were to be preferred, which was always al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to the Subjects of the Grand Signiour, and

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the Seat of Audience, he perceived the Stool ſet for him, was ſet beneath the Soffra, and that of the Viſiers upon it; whereupon he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one of his Servants to place it equal with that of the Great Viſiers, which he had no ſooner done, but it was brought down again by one of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers Pages, whereupon the Embaſſador ſeizing the Stool, carryed it up and ſat upon it. The report whereof coming to the Viſier, who was in his reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Chamber, he ſent word that he would not come into the Chamber of Audience till the Stool was ſet in the place appointed, whereunto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador replyed that he might diſpoſe of his Chair as he pleaſed, but not of his Perſon, when in the interim <hi>Chiaus Baſhe</hi> came in bauling <hi>Calder, Calder,</hi> which is take it away, take it away; at which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected noiſe the Embaſſador ſtanding up to ſee what the matter was, had the ſtool taken from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him; whereupon he in a great rage flung out of the Audience Chamber, cauſing the Preſents which he brought to be again returned with him, and ſo mounting his Horſe, departed to his Lodging.</p>
               <p>Soon after it was by ſome of the Officers intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Sir <hi>John Finch,</hi> His Majeſty of <hi>Great Britains</hi> Embaſſador, that he might if he pleaſed, receive Audience of the Viſier; but upon notice what had

               <p>Theſe things happening, and no hopes of acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation with <hi>Poles,</hi> who by this time had Elected <hi>Sobieski</hi> for their King, great preparations were made for the carrying on that War. The <hi>Tartar, Han,</hi> in order thereto receiving expreſs command to take the Field, which early in the Spring he did, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Lithuania,</hi> committed many outrages, but being incountered by Sixteen Thouſand <hi>Poles,</hi> and <hi>Coſſacks</hi> his Army was put to the rout, and in great confuſion obliged to repaſs the <hi>Neiſter,</hi> leaving behind him all the booty, which conſiſted moſtly of People and Cattle, during which, the Baſſa of <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> with a great Body of Horſe made an Inroad even to the Walls of <hi>Leopolis,</hi> which cauſed the King to ſend his Queen and Children to <hi>Cracow,</hi> reſolving to give the <hi>Turks</hi> Battle, and in order to ſtrengthning his Forces, ſummoned all the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility to repair to his Standard, putting himſelf and ſuch Troops as he had between the City and the Enemy, the better to alienate the fears of the people, who upon the approach of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who burnt up all before them, had fled, and left the City deſolate, had not the Gates been cloſed upon them.</p>
               <p>The Turks perceiving the great preparations that were making againſt them, thought fit with ſuch

               <p>They finding the Turks were reſolutely bent to carry on the War, and that the Kingdom was greatly weakned by the Provinces they had already rent from it, the better to ſtrengthen himſelf by Alliance, by the Advice of the Senate, ſent his Embaſſador to the Court of the <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> to ſolicite Aid againſt the common Enemy, who upon his arrival was received with great expreſſion of Joy, and due Ceremony being dayly heightened with fair promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to expect great matters, but in the end, nothing worth mention came on it, yet it ſo wrought upon the Turks, that for the better preſervation of what they had already required the Viſier began to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent on peace, but his propoſitions were ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that the <hi>Poles</hi> generouſly refuſed them, and early in the Spring prepared to take the Field with a puiſſant Army, yet could not ſo ſoon draw them together, but that the <hi>Tartars</hi> living on the Frontires, joyning with ſome, revolted <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> committed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers out-rages, burning about Two Hundred Villages, carrying away a great number of Chriſtians into mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable captivity, whilſt <hi>Podolia</hi> groaned under the oppreſſion of the Turks, who now turned their clemency into rigour, killing and carrying away great numbers of theſe diſtreſſed people, burning their Houſes, and robbing them of the ſmall matter they had left in ſuch a manner that that fruitful Countrey was layd almoſt deſolate; to op<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe which Torrent, the King drew out his Forces and by fair promiſes and large gifts procured Thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In this Battle Ninety Thouſand <hi>Tartars, Turks, Moldavians</hi> and <hi>Valachians</hi> were ſlain, Seven Hundred taken Priſoners, and a great booty recovered; of the Poles fell only Seven Hundred, their whole Force not exceeding Six Thouſand.

                  <hi>Odenburg,</hi> there to indeavour a Reconciliation, and put an end to the inteſtine troubles, which the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian</hi> Nobility likewiſe urged, and requeſted him to be preſent in the like Royal Robes as the Kings of <hi>Hungary</hi> were wont to apparel themſelves in, but he not conſenting thereto, after ſome debate, and many particulars offered, the Aſſembly broke up without concluding any thing, whereupon Count <hi>Tecke'y</hi> ſiezed on ſeveral Garriſons on the Banks of the <hi>Waga,</hi> and ſent to the Baſſa of <hi>Buda</hi> to haſten the Forces he had in a readineſs, for that he would have no peace with the Emperor unleſs his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals were granted, upon receipt of which Letter, Seventeen Thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> paſſed the <hi>Danubius,</hi> and made great ſpoil, burning and deſtroying all the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages for the ſpace of Fourteen Miles, till <hi>Teckely</hi> moved with the cryes of the poor Country people, who fled like Sheep before them, he ſent an expreſs to the Baſſa that commanded them, to reſtrain them from ſpoiling the Countries.</p>
               <p>The news of theſe proceedings greatly troubled the Emperor, then infeſted with the <hi>French</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and had ſeized upon <hi>Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> a free City of the Empire, yet like a prudent Prince he uſed many perſwaſions to reduce the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to their former obedience, publiſhing his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, wherein he promiſed them all convenient li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for the exerciſe of their Religion, and that they ſhould have a <hi>Palatine,</hi> a native of <hi>Hungary</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering likewiſe a general pardon for all that had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but this availed not, for <hi>Teckely</hi> aiming at the principality of <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> (which he muſt utterly deſpair of obtaining if he diſpleaſed the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior) rejected all theſe reaſonable conceſſions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that he would not truſt to promiſes which were not likely to indure longer than he had power
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:57574:313"/>to right his Countrymen, upon which the Emperor cauſed a detachment of Seven Thouſand Horſe and Foot to be drawn out of his Army, then incamped along the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to have an eye upon the motions of the <hi>French,</hi> to theſe Seven Thouſand he added three new raiſed Regiments, and ſent them to joyn with Count <hi>Caprara</hi> his Lieutenant General in <hi>Hungary,</hi> which reinforcement made the Rebels keep in a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who before had divided themſelves in ſeveral parties, and took in many ſmall Towns, poſſeſſing themſelves of two Silver Mines, and one of the ſtrongeſt <hi>Berg</hi> Towns daily expecting Six Thouſand <hi>Tartars,</hi> who were on their way, under the leading of <hi>Hames Emir Han</hi> their Captain.</p>
               <p>About this time the Grand Seignior fearing the power of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> ſhould refund on part of his Dominions, uſed great diligence by his Agents to procure a Reconciliation, the which was the eaſier hearkened to by reaſon of the differences ariſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the grandees, threatened an inteſtine War, whereupon in <hi>May</hi> 1681. a Truce was concluded for the ſpace of Twenty years, though contrary to the opinion of the <hi>Polonians,</hi> who by a conjunction with the numerous Forces of that Dukedom, were in hopes to gain more eaſie conditions at the Port then in the Articles between them and the Grand Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or were included, in order to which that King had aſſembled a <hi>Diet</hi> at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> which after Sixteen weeks conſultation, by reaſon of the perverſeneſs of a deputy of <hi>Lythuania,</hi> broke up without reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on any one point referred to their conſideration.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of the year 1682. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror diſpatched a Miniſter to Count <hi>Teckeley,</hi> who was fortifying divers places againſt him, to treat of an accommodation as himſelf had required, but he having received an Aſſurance from the Port of the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:57574:313"/>Grand Signiours protection declared that he had not full power to treat of himſelf, but muſt be obliged to take the advice of the Baſſa of <hi>Offa</hi> in that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, and move according to the directions he ſhould receive from the Port, having wholly thrown him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the Grand Signiors, and therefore refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all to the ſucceſs of Count <hi>Capraras</hi> Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vice Admiral <hi>Herbert</hi> having obliged the <hi>Algerine</hi> Pirates to a complyance, the treaty of peace was about the latter end of <hi>April</hi> brought by Captain <hi>Almyer</hi> for his Majeſties Approbation and Ratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both which being had, the Treaty both Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and advantagious to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation was returned, the ſucceſs againſt theſe Rovers having been ſuch as has given reputation to his Majeſties Arms in thoſe parts, and will paſt doubt give them cauſe to value his Majeſties Friendſhip for the future.</p>
               <p>The ſeaſon for Action advancing, the Emperor cauſed Six Regiments of Foot, and two of Horſe to march for <hi>Hungary,</hi> to inable Count <hi>Caprara</hi> to oppoſe the Turks that had imbodied themſelves near <hi>Offen,</hi> as likewiſe about <hi>Sonluck,</hi> between great <hi>Waradin,</hi> and the River <hi>Theis,</hi> which parties upon their uniting were further inforced by the Troops of Count <hi>Teckeley,</hi> and <hi>Abaftie</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and for the better aſſurance of the former, the Grand Signiour cauſed to be placed about him One Thouſand <hi>Janizaries</hi> as a Guard to his perſon, which many did at that time believe it was to no other end then to ſecure him in the intereſt of the Port. Theſe Forces of <hi>Turks, Hungarians,</hi> and <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvanians</hi> meeting, it was in the Baſſa's Tent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that ſince the <hi>German</hi> Forces were not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable on that ſide, they ſhould divide into two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:57574:314"/>and act ſeparate, one to be commanded by the Count, and the other by the Baſſa of <hi>Waradin,</hi> upon which the former immediately beſieged <hi>Chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caw,</hi> a ſtrong City near the <hi>Waag,</hi> battering it for many days with twelve pieces of Cannon, carrying the out-work by ſtorm, but perceiving his Camp an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed by the ſhot from the City; into which Count <hi>Straſoldo</hi> had put Five Hundred Men he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved his Battery to a ſmall Hill which comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, and from thence playing furiouſly, he beat down a great number of Houſes, and layed open a great breach in the Wall, which obliged the beſieged after many Sallies, and a reſolute defence to capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate for their Lives and Liberties which were granted, and leave given for as many as would, to take ſervice under his Enſigns, but whilſt the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers haſtily entered, whether of purpoſe, or by chance, a Mine near the breach took Fire, and blew up ſeveral of the <hi>Teckeleyans,</hi> which ſo inraged them, that they fell upon the Garriſon, and put many of them to the Sword e're their fury could be ſtayed; the Citizens to redeem themſelves from being plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, payed Fifty Thouſand Crowns, and two days after <hi>Eſpiers</hi> ſurrendred to the Count.</p>
               <p>During this Action, the Baſſa beſieged <hi>Zathmar,</hi> which after divers attempts they carryed by force, putting many to the Sword, and carrying away a conſiderable number of all Sex and Ages into miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable captivity.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Teckeley</hi> upon this ſucceſs, ſent Summons from his Camp near <hi>Lewentz,</hi> to ſummon the <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Nobility to appear in Arms, but by the Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Miniſters, he failed for the moſt part in his expectation, few obeying his Orders, yet many of the inferiour rank came to increaſe the number of his Forces; upon notice of which Count
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:57574:314"/>
                  <hi>Caprara,</hi> and Count <hi>Straſoldo</hi> joyned their Forces, and marched to oppoſe the Torrent e're it ſwelled too high. The Emperor ſent likewiſe an Expreſs to the <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Hungary</hi> to raiſe the Ban and Areirban of that Kingdom, and to march with all ſpeed againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> who had paſſed the <hi>Waag,</hi> and cauſed the Governour of <hi>Chaſcaw</hi> to be impriſoned, as being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of not having defended that City to Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and now the Armies being within view of each other, there was great expectations that the Iſſue would have been a foughten Field, but it proved otherwiſe; for after ſome light skirmiſhes had paſt, the Imperialiſts finding themſelves too weak, quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Camp at <hi>Atſol,</hi> and retired toward St. <hi>Croix,</hi> which ſo diſcouraged the Garriſon in <hi>Lewentz,</hi> that they abandoned it, and retired to places of greater ſtrength, ſo that it became a prey to the Enemy.</p>
               <p>All this while the Turks having beſieged <hi>Villecke,</hi> after divers Aſſaults and great ſlaughter of their Men, had it delivered into their hands on the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>September,</hi> the Garriſon making articles of ſurrender without the conſent of the Governour, who upon his refuſing to ſign the capitulation, was made a Priſoner of War, and the Turks unwilling to put this Fortreſs into the hands of the <hi>Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as by Articles was agreed; and on the other ſide the <hi>Hungarians</hi> being loath that the Turks ſhould poſſeſs ſo ſtrong a place in the heart of the Kingdom; it for ſome time occaſioned great conteſt, but in the end both parties concluded to demoliſh it, which was accordingly done.</p>
               <p>During theſe Tranſactions, his Imperial Majeſties Embaſſador at the Port was flattered with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of renewing the League between the two Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, and conducted to his Audience with the uſual
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:57574:315"/>Ceremonies, which was only to protract time till the Turks had poſſeſſed themſelves of ſuch ſtrong places as might render them formidable, and give them hopes of annexing all <hi>Hungary</hi> to the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire; but the <hi>German</hi> Princes perceiving their drift, ſent ſeveral of their own Troops to reinforce the <hi>Imperial</hi> Army under the Command of Count <hi>Caprara,</hi> with whom the Count <hi>Stroſoldo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to joyn, in order to give the Turks Battle near <hi>Lewentz,</hi> fell into the Emperors high diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure being ſent for to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and for a while is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended, but upon his ſubmiſſion was again reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to favour.</p>
               <p>Winter approaching, Count <hi>Teckely</hi> ſent Four Huſſars to Count <hi>Caprara,</hi> to procure of him a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port for the ſafe paſſage of ſuch Deputies as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſend to the Emperor to treat of a Truce which Huſſars were by the Counts expreſs Command Impriſoned till ſuch time his <hi>Imperial</hi> Majeſties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was known therein; but in the end they were releaſed, and the Deputies permitted to paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controuled, when after many debates a Truce was concluded for two Moneths, whereupon Count <hi>Teokley</hi> by reaſon of the Difference between him, and the Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> retired with the greateſt part of his Troop to a ſtrong place, which together with ſome others in dowrie with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Ragotski,</hi> whom this year he had married.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1683. Early in the Spring, the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> taking the Field, and ſeveral skirmiſhes happening between parties, with various ſucceſs. The Count <hi>Wallaſtain,</hi> his <hi>Imperial</hi> Majeſties Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

               <p>Whilſt matters were thus carryed on that ſide the King of <hi>Sweeden</hi> has obliged himſelf to aſſiſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour with ſeven thouſand Horſe and Foot, four thouſand of which he intends to raiſe in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the reſt in his own Countries, nor will the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> who is in all likelihood ſhortly to marry the Emperors Daughter, be wanting to ſend his Forces againſt the common Enemy.</p>

For the Emperor in perſon having been at the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous near <hi>Presburg</hi> in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> was ſo well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the order of his men that he altogether contemned the Forces of the Enemy.

               <p>On the 11th. of <hi>May</hi> the Imperial Army after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Randizvouzed at <hi>Preſburg,</hi> paſſing from <hi>Keiſer</hi> marched towards, and incamped between that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and <hi>Comorra</hi> to obſerve the motions of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were imbodyed near <hi>Newhauſel</hi> to the number of 15000, daily expecting a detachment of the Viſiers Army upon its march to joyn with them, the Viſier at the ſame time being incamped at <hi>Greick Weiffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> expecting the arrival of the Grand Seignior, who was ſome days marching behind.</p>
               <p>During theſe proceedings <hi>Teckely</hi> ſuddenly collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Troops, layed ſiege to the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Donowitz,</hi> in which was the Barron <hi>Joannel</hi> with a Garriſon of 250 <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>Hungarians,</hi> yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a furious battery with 8 pieces of Cannon, he made himſelf maſter of that important place, making the Governour and the <hi>Germans</hi> found therein Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of War, when to prevent his further proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on that ſide, the <hi>Pallatine</hi> of <hi>Hungaria</hi> received orders to joyn Major General <hi>Schutz,</hi> who had paſſed the <hi>Waag</hi> to meet the Prince of <hi>Lubomerski,</hi> who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with the 6000 <hi>Polonian</hi> Horſe before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, whereupon the Viſier of <hi>Buda</hi> ſummoned Count <hi>Teekely</hi> to joyn the Turkiſh Troops under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which he refuſed to do, making ſeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:57574:318"/>to excuſe it of which the King of <hi>Poland</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice ſent a Letter to the Count to adviſe him to quit the engagement he has with the Turks, (which in concluſion will turn to his ruin) and make his peace with the Emperour, whilſt his free grace is offered him; the which had ſuch an effectual ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that many were of opinion he would have cloſed with the Imperial offered Grace, but after ſome debate and new incouragement from the Grand Signior, he reſolved to perſiſt in his rebellious purpoſe of oppoſing the Emperours intereſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> who has abſolute power to act as he ſees convenient for the advantage of the Empire, ſent orders to the <hi>Palatine</hi> to draw down his Troops and intrench himſelf on the banks of the <hi>Waag,</hi> to ſecure the paſſes where the River is Ford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as likewiſe to the Vice-Roy of <hi>Crotia</hi> to raiſe new Forces for the increaſe of thoſe already under his command, and to keep diligent watch upon the Frontires of that Province to prevent any incurſions.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Zathmer</hi> was regained, and young Count <hi>Serini</hi> (true Heir to the valour of his immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Anceſtors) appointed Governour thereof which has put the Turks out of all hopes of recovering it.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> having notice that the Turks were imbodying themſelves near <hi>Gran,</hi> raiſed his Camp on the 24th. of <hi>May</hi> and marched towards them, reſolving to give them Battle before the Grand Viſier (who together with the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> was on his march) could arrive in thoſe parts, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for that purpoſe ſtored his Army with all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Proviſion and Ammunition ſent up the <hi>Danu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> in boats from <hi>Vienna,</hi> but during theſe prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Turks had ſo ſtrongly lodged themſelves upon the Counterſcarp to the number of 25000, that he thought it not convenient to attack them in their

               <p>The Count <hi>Caprara</hi> His Imperial Majeſties Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador at the Port, is by order of the Grand Signeour looked narrowly after, not differing much from a confinement, leaſt during theſe Hoſtilities he ſhould

The Liſt whereof take as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> The Emperor has in pay 27 Regiments of Foot, making together 55700 men, whereof 25296 follow the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> 4692 are appointed to ſecure the upper <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> 2040 poſted at <hi>Jabluncka</hi> on the frontiers of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> 2040 at <hi>Leopolſtadt</hi> on the <hi>Waag,</hi> 3640 in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> 2040 at <hi>Vienna,</hi> 13912 in the Empire, 2400 in <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> 17 Regiments of Horſe making together 13600 men, 7 Regiments of Dragoons containing 5600 men, &amp; 4 Regiments of <hi>Croats</hi> making 3200, whereof 15200 are at the Camp, 800 in the Upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> 400 at <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bluncka,</hi> 2400 at <hi>Leopolſtadt,</hi> 800 in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and 2800 in the Empire.

               </head>
               <p>HAving in the ſuccinct Series of this Hiſtory related the Original of the <hi>Ottoman Empire,</hi> and its Growth from time to time, till it arrived to the vaſt Extent it at this Day is found; I ſhall now proceed to give the <hi>Reader</hi> a View of the Grandeur of it, and by what means it is ſupported, in the Deſcription of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Port or Palace, Government, Officers, Riches, Forces, Religion, and the like.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> originally a People of <hi>Scythia,</hi> ſuppoſed to have ſprung from the Ten Tribes carried into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, as is in the former Part of this Hiſtory related, began their Second Empire in <hi>Aſia</hi> under <hi>Othoman,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 1300; and ſpreading wide, entred <hi>Europe,</hi> ſeizing at length upon the pleaſant City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the <hi>Greek Emperour,</hi> and making it the Imperial Seat of the <hi>Othoman Sultans,</hi> now dignified by the Title of <hi>Grand Seigniors:</hi> A Deſcription of which City, and of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> or Imperial Port or Palace, take as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> built by <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Opinion of many, ſixteeen Miles in circuit, called by the <hi>Turks, Stambul</hi> or <hi>Stombolda;</hi> the Sea bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon it on the North and South ſides, and on the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:57574:320"/>Eaſt it is divided from <hi>Aſia</hi> by a large Channel, which runneth from the one Sea to the other, being ſeven Miles in length, called the <hi>Straights of Boſphorus.</hi> The City is built upon the declining of a Hill; for Buildings comparable to any in the World: But above all, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with ſeven <hi>Moſques</hi> ſtanding upon ſeven little Hills, founded by ſeven of the <hi>Ottoman Emperors;</hi> of which, that of Sultan <hi>Solyman</hi> is moſt famous: And the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi> now made the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Palace, which is three Miles in circuit, ſtandeth on the North ſide, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on the one ſide of it the Sea, and on the other the Haven; the other two Parts being encompaſſed with the Building of the City. This Palace, Port, or Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio, which you pleaſe, (for all theſe Names it bears) has within it many Gardens, Orchards, Meadows, Woods, pleaſant Groves, Fountains, and all things elſe that can render it delightful. The Entrance is through a Gate of Iron into a large Court, where on the left hand ſtands a Building like a <hi>Turkiſh Moſque,</hi> which is uſed as a Store-houſe for Arms and Proviſion; on the Right, are ſeveral fair Gardens palazadoed in, from which they paſs to another Court, with a Gate like unto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; upon which hang many Targets, Scymitars, and other Weapons of War, many Porters attending; through which they paſs into another large Court, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Cyprus</hi>-Trees; where many Deer are kept: which Court is ſurrounded with a Cloyſter, which is in length 680 Foot, and in breadth 500; paved with Marble, leaded over, and ſupported by 140 Pillars of White and Gray Marble curiouſly wrought, ſtanding upon Baſis of Copper, with Capitals of the like Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. On the North ſide ſtands the <hi>Divano,</hi> or Council-Houſe, where the <hi>Grand Vizier,</hi> and ſuch others as are by the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> appointed his Councellors, four times a Week, or oftner of Occaſion require it, ſit to conſult the Important Affairs of the Empire; to hear
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:57574:321"/>and determine all Matters of Controverſie, and give Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Ambaſſadors, and other Forreign Miniſters.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Seraglio</hi> the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> has many Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers hung with Cloth of Gold, gilded Skins, and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtries made of Silk and Gold; wherein are lively repreſented the Wars of the <hi>Ottoman Emperours.</hi> His Lodging-Chamber is garniſhed with divers Precious Stones of great value; and conſtantly attending him ſix young Men, who do Service in his Chamber, and watch his Perſon all Night, two and two by turns, with lighted Torches; the one ſitting at the Head, and the other at the Feet of his Bed: And when he attires him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, they put into his Pockets a thouſand <hi>Aſpars,</hi> and twenty <hi>Ducats</hi> of Gold; the which, if he does not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute that Day, at Night is their Fee; for he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never puts on one Suit of Apparel twice; and whenſoever he goes to Hunting, or any the like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, (beſides the Money in his Pockets) his <hi>Caſnadar Baſſa,</hi> or Chief Treaſurer, follows him with great ſtore of Money to give away: Of theſe ſix Young Men, who are changed at Pleaſure, their Offices are diſtinct; for the firſt carries his Shoes, the ſecond his Bow and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, the Third his Veſt, the fourth a Veſſel with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the fifth his Seat, and the ſixth, called <hi>Oda Baſſa,</hi> is Head of the Chamber.</p>

               <p>Theſe Six Officers have no Authority out of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio;</hi> yet the greateſt Baſſa's fear them, for that they being always near the Emperour, frequently incenſe him againſt them to their Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Near unto the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Perſon, are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſix Mutes, Men born both Deaf and Dumb, with whom he makes himſelf Paſtime. There are found likewiſe about thirty four more of the ſame Tribe, which he keeps as Executioners of his Wrath; for upon the leaſt Command, they will ſtrangle the greateſt Baſſa of the Court, or otherwiſe make him away, it being their frequent Practice.</p>
               <p>Within the <hi>Seraglio</hi> are kept to the number of five hundred, ſuch Youths as are taken up for Tribute-Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in <hi>Graecia,</hi> and other Parts of the Empire; all Sons of Chriſtians, who taken young from their Parents, are inſtructed and brought up in divers Arts; and taught more eſpecially to manage all ſorts of Weapons, and to be perfect in the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Superſtition; few of them being above eight Years of Age at their firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. Of theſe, ſome they make <hi>Janizaries;</hi> others
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:57574:322"/>are preferred to Offices of Truſt, and come to great Preferment: But none of them may, on Pain of Death, ſtir out of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> till the <hi>Sultan</hi> thinks them of a fit Age, and ſufficiently qualified for his Service. He has in like manner eighty <hi>Mutaferache,</hi> or Launce Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, who carry his Launce; and are ſubject to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of none but himſelf.</p>
               <p>He hath in continual pay a thouſand Eunuches, whom the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Hundurni;</hi> many of which are imployed to attend his Virgins and Concubines in the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> They are not only deprived of their Genitors, but in their Youth they have their whole Privities ſmoothed off by their Bellies: And in their Turbants they bear a Silver Quill or Crue, through which they evacuate their Urine. This Inhuman Barbarity was firſt commanded by <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent, who grew jealous of them upon his obſerving a Gelding back a Mare; gathering from thence, that his Eunuches though they had loſt their Genitor, might yet dalliance with his Females.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Seraglio</hi> of Women is within the Palace, in which are conſtantly five hundred Virgins, the choiceſt Beauties that can be procured, being all Daughters to Chriſtians, taken from their Parents when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight Years of Age or under; none above are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, leſt they ſhould be debauched e're they enter. Theſe are brought up to curious Works: And when at any time the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> is deſirous to have any of them brought to his Bed, he the Day before gives notice to the Captain of the Eunuches; who commands thoſe under him to put them in order, and array them in their beſt Attire. Which done the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> attended by the ſaid Captain, walking between them as they ſtand demurely in rowes on either Hand; and where he likes, drops his Handkerchief, of which he has many hanging at his Girdle; which the Eunuches that follow, obſerving, put her (or as many as his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:57574:322"/>is to ſignifie by ſuch Tokens) into a Coach, and carry them to his Lodgings; where they are gorgeouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attired, and uſed as he has occaſion for them: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they return, not to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of the Virgins, but have other Lodgings appointed them. And when by reaſon of the Failure of Tribute-Virgins, the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio</hi> grows empty, they purchaſe the Faireſt they can find in the Market of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whither they are brought to be ſold as Slaves.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>Seraglio</hi> there is, in which the <hi>Grand Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> keeps his <hi>Sultana's</hi> or <hi>Sultaneſſes,</hi> and their Children; as likewiſe, ſuch other Concubines, of whom for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light he hath choſen from amongſt the Virgins. He never marries; but when any one is brought to his Bed ſide, he gives her a Golden Head-tire, and ten thouſand <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;</hi> cauſing her to live apart, daily increaſing her Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. The firſt that bears him a Child, is called the <hi>Sultana</hi> or <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> and is accounted Miſtreſs of the reſt of his Women; and by him, for the moſt part, beſt beloved. The reſt that hath been brought to his Bed, and with whom he hath dallianced, are returned back to their ſeveral Apartments, there to expect the Iſſue; and if they prove not with Child, then are they given in Marriage to his Slaves; whom for their ſakes he advances to great Dignity, for the moſt part.</p>
               <p>He hath three hundred <hi>Sollacchi,</hi> who march conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually about his Perſon, and make (as it were) his Guard, being under the Command of the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries;</hi> all of them attired in Linnen-Garments hanging down beneath their Knees; and over them quilted Waſt-Coats, with half Sleeves of Taffety, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask, or Sattin; and on their Heads Caps and Feathers, carrying Bows and Arrows.

               <p>The <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Power is ſo abſolute, and his Government ſo tyrannical, that his Subjects term them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves his Slaves; none of them being ſure of his Life or Goods beyond his Pleaſure; for without any Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or Proceſs, he puts to Death whom it pleaſeth him, unleſs reſtrained by the Souldiers, who often reſcue their Minions out of his Hands, and oblige him to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Chief Councellor is the Great <hi>Vizier;</hi> who wears his Signet, and is ſtiled his <hi>Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant;</hi> every <hi>Divano</hi>-day giving him an exact Account what is ſaid and done: Nor dare he diſſemble in ought; for that the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> has a Window, from whence he can ſee and hear, and yet not be ſeen himſelf; which Window looks into the <hi>Divano.</hi> When this <hi>Vizier</hi> is

               </p>
               <p>Next unto the <hi>Baſſa's,</hi> (of which there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſperſed throughout the Empire, to manage the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs thereof) are the <hi>Beglerbegs,</hi> or Lords of Lords: They are Men of great Authority, and have the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of great Kingdoms and Armies; under whoſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience are divers <hi>Sanzacks,</hi> which are ſent as Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors into Provinces, during the Princes Pleaſure; being Men of great Experience; for the moſt part, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding over the <hi>Spahi</hi> and <hi>Timariots,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> chief Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whom they continually exerciſe to render them the more expert.

               <p>The <hi>Beglerbegs,</hi> or Great Commanders of the <hi>Turk</hi>'s Empire in <hi>Aſia,</hi> are thirty in number; under whom are a proportionable number of <hi>Sanzacks,</hi> and not leſs than

                     </gap>hoglanians, Silictarians,</hi> and <hi>Olofagians;</hi> who have likewiſe Lands, or Annual Penſions aſſigned them; for which they are bound to ſerve in the Wars: for no Man in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire can have any Lands, or Yearly Revenues that way, but muſt be ready, or ſend others in his ſtead; it being held, that the whole Empire in Fee ſimple, is the Grand Seigniors: No Man being permitted to buy or injoy any Lands longer, than it pleaſes his Prince: Nor can any one claim a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety to a Foot, unleſs by the Donation of the Grand Seignior, or his Aſſignment; and that laſt, at longeſt, but during the Natural Life of him, to whom it is ſo given or aſſigned. Theſe Horſemen march under a white Banner, being armed with ſtrong Coats, Bows, and Arrows, Culeverings, Scymitars, and Battle Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</p>
               <p>Another ſort of Horſemen there are, called <hi>Caripices,</hi> not exceeding eight hundred; who ſtill ride near the Grand Seignior, as his Life-guard, in the middle of the Battalion of the <hi>Janizaries;</hi> and are the beſt Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men accounted of all others, being (for the moſt part) Sons of the Great Commanders.</p>
               <p>As for his Foot Forces, the chief Strength conſiſts of <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who are Children taken from their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Parents, and inured in their Youth to all manner of Hardſhip, taught all the Uſe of Arms, and trained up in all Warlike Diſcipline, till they are adjudged fit to be inrolled for the War. Theſe are taken up in <hi>Europe,</hi> no Children born either in <hi>Aſia</hi> or <hi>Africa</hi> being admitted into their Seminary. Theſe Men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:57574:324"/>incloſe the Perſon of the Grand Seignior at what time he marches with his Army; and are the laſt that fight, unleſs urgent Neceſſity require it. They wear white Caps, carry Harquibuſſes, and ſharp Scymitars; who ſince their firſt Inſtitution have been the chief Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire; but of late they are much degenerated from their former Diſcipline, giving themſelves up wholly to Eaſe and Pleaſure; yet keep themſelves in good order, for the moſt part. There remains twenty four thouſand of them in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and a far greater number in divers Places of the Empire. They are commanded by their <hi>Aga,</hi> or Captain, to whom nothing is ſo fatal as their Love for him; for then the Grand Seignior has him in miſtruſt, and well is it if he be not made away. They ſleep together in great Halls, their Beds being placed on either ſide; and all thoſe of a Squadron feed at one Table; the Younger ever ſerve the Elder: And if any one of them be abſent from his Lodging in the Night, unleſs upon publick occaſion, then is he the next day ſeverely c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelled, and nevertheleſs obliged to kiſs the Hand that beat him. Their Imploys are different in time of Peace; for ſome wait upon Ambaſſadors, others upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Conſuls, others again upon ſuch as travel through the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire. They likewiſe arreſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, and ſee good Order kept, being feared of all Men; inſomuch that if they buy any thing, they will have it at their own Price, the Vender not daring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it. They have great Power in their Princes Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; no Emperour thinking himſelf ſafe in his Throne, till they approve of him: So that to gain their good Opinion, every new Emperour at his entring upon the Government, diſtributes large Sums of Money amongſt them, and increaſes their Stipends.</p>
               <p>Though the chief Strength of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Foot For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces reſts in the <hi>Janizaries;</hi> yet are there another ſort
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:57574:325"/>of Foot-Men, called <hi>Acouices;</hi> which is a Forlorn Hope. Theſe receive no Pay, but have free liberty to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; ſo that they deliver the fifth Part to the Grand Seigniour. Another kind there are, called <hi>Aſapi;</hi> who are but of ſmall Account, and rather uſed as <hi>Pioneers,</hi> than to encounter the Enemy; yet are they often thruſt into the Front of the Battle, with their Bodies to blunt the Enemies Swords, or to ſcale the Walls of Towns; that by being ſlaughter'd, their Dead Bodies may fill up the Ditches, and ſo give the <hi>Janizaries</hi> opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on their Dead Carkaſſes to mount the Bullwarks.</p>
               <p>The Grand Seignior keeps in continual Pay ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Gunners, whom the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Topegi;</hi> and for the Guard of the Powder and Shot, upon the March of the Army, twelve thouſand Men are kept in pay, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Jebegi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Grand Seignior hath likewiſe certain Officers at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on him, to the number of three thouſand, whom they call <hi>Chiaus;</hi> which act in the Nature of Serjeants at Arms. Theſe Men are well eſteemed, and are often employed in Embaſſies to Forreign Princes: They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo carry Letters or Commendations from the Grand Seignior, or his Chief Vizier; and are impower'd to apprehend Malefactors: But never go to the Wars, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Grand Seignior be there in Perſon. They are commanded by a <hi>Chiaus Baſſa;</hi> who is of ſuch Credit with all Men, that when he is ſent by the Grand Seignior to any <hi>Baſſa, Sanzack,</hi> or <hi>Caddi,</hi> to have any Man's Head cut off, though he have no Warrant in writing, yet his Authority is not diſputed.</p>
               <p>Thus have I ſet down the Land Forces of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire; in number ſo great, that in ſhew they ſhould breed Confuſion, and ruin themſelves; yet ſuch is the Order and Diſcipline, that in that point they give place to none. They live (for the moſt part) on a little Bread
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:57574:325"/>baked in the Aſhes, with Rice and Powder of Fleſh dried in the Sun. Wine is forbidden them by their Law, though 'tis often drunk by them in private, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Great Commanders. No Women are ſeen in their Armies. In their March they obſerve a wonderful Silence; and all the Soldiers are governed by the Beck of the Hand, or Shew of the Countenance. Quarrels and Thefts are ſeverely puniſhed. When they March they dare not enter any Corn-field or Vineyard. The Valiant are aſſured of Preferment, and the Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>As for the Grand Seignior's Naval Forces, they are great; he having of late, for Gain-ſake, allured many Chriſtian Carpenters and Shipwrights to his Arſenal, and hath a great number of Men trained up in Marine Affairs, by being continually imployed aboard his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies at <hi>Rhodes, Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Mitylene</hi> and <hi>Alexandria.</hi> He has alſo at his Beck the Pirates of <hi>Tunis, Tripoley, Sally, Argire,</hi> and other Places; from amongſt whom he chooſes his prime Commanders in Marine Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
               <p>To maintain theſe great Forces, it is requiſite a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Maſs of Money ſhould be imployed, which is the Sinews of War, and without which ſo great an Empire could not be kept in frame, though many are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Grand Seignior's Annual Revenues exceed not eight Millions; meaning thereby, that which is collected of his Subjects, and upon the account of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms: For which they give theſe Reaſons: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Turks</hi> have no care but of Arms; the which do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ruin, than enrich a Country. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume ſo many Men in their Enterprizes, that they ſcarce leave a ſufficient number to manure the Land; inſomuch that the Subjects deſpairing to injoy their Wealth, and neceſſary Commodities, which they might get by their Labour and Induſtry, employ not themſelves to work
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:57574:326"/>nor traffick, more than by neceſſity they are conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For they argue, 'tis to no purpoſe to labour for another, their Lives and Eſtates being daily expoſed to the Mercy of their Prince: And for this Reaſon, many ſpacious Countries in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire lie waſte; which neglect frequently cauſes a Dearth. A <hi>Third</hi> Reaſon that is given, why the Grand Seignior's Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues are no greater, is, for that when he Conquers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Country, he aſſigns the Lands therein to his <hi>Tima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,</hi> who ſerve in the Wars, and are no otherwiſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to accommodate their Prince.</p>
               <p>But although his ordinary Revenues amount to no great Sum, in conſideration of the large Circuit of his Empire; yet his extraordinary Profits accruing by Confiſcations, Preſents, (for no Stranger may approach his Preſence empty handed) and Mony raiſed upon Places and Offices of Truſt, amount to a far greater Sum than what has been mentioned. Nor are the Sums ſmall, which he draws from the Princes their Tributaries, that are not abſolutely under his Juriſdiction; as <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davia, Vallachia,</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> with many more. So that in all, moderate Writers affirm, That his Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers are yearly ſupplied with twenty Millions: The Management of which is left to the <hi>Defterdari,</hi> or chief Treaſurer, who has many Sub-officers under him.</p>
               <p>Thus much having been ſpoken of the Forces, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, and great Officers; I ſhall now proceed to give the <hi>Reader</hi> a View of their Religion, if it may without offence be ſo termed; which they call the Law of their great Prophet.</p>
               <p>As for their Religion, it began in the time of <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clius</hi> the Emperor; at what time the Hereſie of <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Neſtorius</hi> ſpread it ſelf: to whoſe Infamous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Impoſtor, born in <hi>Arabia,</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf; impiouſly denying the Divinity of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and proclaiming himſelf a Prophet ſent from <hi>God,</hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:57574:326"/>a Multitude after him: Inſomuch that ſuch as would not receive his impious Tenents by fair means, he compelled by force: And the better to ingratiate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the lewd and licentious ſort of People, he to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated all manner of Luſt, and Worldly Delights. By the Law this Impoſtor left, and that now has overſpread two Parts of the World, a Diſtinction is made between clean and unclean Meats, to content the <hi>Jews,</hi> who are the greateſt Merchants in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire. They alſo maintain Circumciſion, but not at the Expiration of Eight Days, according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cuſtom; but at the End of Eight Years, when the Infant is able to make a Confeſſion of his Belief; and lifting up his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ſpeak theſe words in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue, <hi>viz. There is but One God, and Mahomet is his Prophet; one God, and equal Prophets.</hi> The Circumciſion ended, they feaſt three Days. As for the Female Children, they at eight Years old ſpeak the ſame words; but are not capable of Circumciſion. If any Chriſtian turn A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate, and deny his Redeemer, which (to the loſs of their Souls) too many do, only to avoid Taxations and Tribute, they are led through the Town or City, where they dwell in great Triumph, many People pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting them with Gifts, as they paſs, to encourage them to perſevere in what they have undertaken. And for the Men, at what Age ſoever they are, they muſt be Circumciſed.</p>
               <p>The Law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> is contained in his <hi>Alchoran;</hi> wherein he confeſſeth <hi>One God, and honoureth Jeſus Chriſt as a great Prophet:</hi> But impiouſly denies him to be the Son of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> by their Law are forbid to worſhip Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or to have any placed in their <hi>Moſques:</hi> The whole Series of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> being full of Fables and Fictions, much like to thoſe the Poets feigned of the <hi>Elizium</hi>-Shades; indulging Men in all Senſuality during this
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:57574:327"/>Life, and promiſing them a <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> where they ſhall enjoy the like more perfectly after Death.</p>
               <p>Their Sabbath is kept on our <hi>Fryday.</hi> They keep Lent thirty Days; during which ſpace they eat nothing in the day-time, but take their Repaſt after Sun-ſet, abſtaining from Wine and Women. This Lent is called by them <hi>Ramaden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They likewiſe obſerve an <hi>Eaſter,</hi> called <hi>Bayran;</hi> which continues for the ſpace of the three Days, though not always prefixed by reaſon they begin it in the New of the Moon.</p>
               <p>They have no Bells in their <hi>Moſques;</hi> neither do they ſuffer the Chriſtians to have any that live amongſt them. When they enter the ſaid <hi>Moſques,</hi> they leave their Shooes at the Door, and take them again when they return. Where ſoever they ſit or ſtand in their Religious Houſes, they have Tapeſtry or Mats under them, as not thinking their Feet holy enough to ſtand in that Place, during the Reading their Law; and if they look back, or ſcratch their Head till the Orizon is ended, they think they have loſt the Benefit they were at that time to receive by their coming thither. They are not much addicted to Learning; yet of late they have brought up their Children to uſe the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue, in which their Law is written.</p>
               <p>By this Law they have leave to marry as many Wives as they can maintain; and when once any of them proves with Child, her Husband may not carnally know her till ſhe is delivered. They have certain Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages contracted during Pleaſure, which they call <hi>Kebin,</hi> moſtly practiſed by Strangers; who may, for a certain Sum of Money, have the Uſe of a Woman during his Pleaſure: Yet when he turns her off, if ſhe have any Children, he is bound to keep them. A <hi>Turk</hi> having had to do with a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Woman, both of them upon Conviction are to ſuffer Death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:57574:327"/>ſhe add ſin to ſin, by renouncing her Faith. The like is to be obſerved between a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and a <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> VVoman; though either Offence, by bribing the <hi>Caddi's</hi> or Judges, may be omitted.</p>
               <p>They allow of Divorce in caſe of Barrenneſs or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency.</p>
               <p>The chief Interpreter of theſe Laws, is the <hi>Muphti,</hi> or <hi>Arch-Prieſt,</hi> who is choſen by the Grand Seignior; and is greatly reverenced amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> being Head of their Church, and Decider of all Controverſies ariſing in matter of their Superſtitious Religion. His Eminency is ſuch, that all the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> are ſubject to his Direction. He abaſeth himſelf not ſo much as to ſit in the <hi>Divano;</hi> only paſſing through it, when he is ſent for by the Grand Seignior; who at his approach riſeth from his Seat, (an Honour not allowed to any other) and then they ſit together, and familiarly diſcourſe of their Affairs.</p>
               <p>The next to him are the <hi>Cadileſquires,</hi> or <hi>Taliſmen:</hi> Two Doctors of the Law, whoſe place it is to Examine the <hi>Caddi's</hi> or Judges, who are diſperſed throughout the Provinces of the Empire, and are always attendant upon the Grand Seignior: The one of them having Juriſdiction over all the <hi>European Caddi's,</hi> and the other on thoſe reſiding in <hi>Aſia;</hi> there being few Cities, or great Towns, in which one of the <hi>Caddi's</hi> have not their Reſidence there, to hear and determine Matters of Controverſie ariſing between Man and Man. The <hi>Cadileſquires</hi> are likewiſe Soveraign Judges within their own Juriſdiction, in all Cauſes belonging to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as it were Patriarks. They are of great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and have places in the <hi>Divano,</hi> and in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil with the <hi>Baſſa's,</hi> conſult the weighty Affairs of the Empire.</p>
               <p>There is a third Degree of Church-Men, not belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Law, called <hi>Mulli;</hi> which they account
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:57574:328"/>their Biſhops, and are directed in their Affairs by the <hi>Muphti.</hi> Their Office is to place and diſplace Church-Men as they ſee it convenient.</p>
               <p>Another ſort there are, called the <hi>Nuderiſi,</hi> who act in the nature of Suffragans, and have under them ſeveral young Doctors of the Law, who are their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, called <hi>Naipi;</hi> who are, in the Abſence of the <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di's,</hi> conſtituted to hear and redreſs Grievances.</p>
               <p>After theſe are the <hi>Hagi,</hi> who are employed to write their Books, they in no wiſe allowing them to be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and inferior unto theſe are the <hi>Caſſi,</hi> who read un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them what they write, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are their ſeveral Degrees of Lawyers, and Church-Men; for the <hi>Turks</hi> are governed by a kind of Eccleſiaſtical Law, according to their <hi>Alchoran.</hi> Many Colledges they have, which they call <hi>Medreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae's,</hi> ſituate not only in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but in divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cities.</p>

            <p>By this time the <hi>Turks</hi> had far advanced their Trenches, and began to throw their Bombs into the City, whereupon the Citizens covered many of their houſes near the wall with earth, and with the ſhot of the Cannons from the Tower, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the mortars, ſallying out at the ſame time, and making a terrible ſlaughter of the enemy, who were advancing to the wall with a deſign to enter the new breach, recovering from them a Baſtion of which they had poſſeſſed themſelves, and cutting in pieces all they found therein.</p>

            <p>The increaſe of the Chriſtian Camp did not a little trouble the Viſier, who well knew that if he could not make himſelf maſter of the City before the King of <hi>Poland</hi> arrived, he muſt be obliged to give battle, or raiſe his ſiege, and that if he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried in the former, it would greatly redound to his diſgrace, if not hazzard his life, by rendring him obnoxious to the Grand Signiours diſpleaſure, whom he had aſſured of taking the City; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to haſten the enterprize he ſpared not his men, but thruſt them on even into the mouth of ſlaughter, ſwearing by <hi>Mahomet</hi> that in whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he found the leaſt mark of cowardiſe, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of duty he ſhould be put to death, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he commanded the Cannon from all the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries to play without ceaſing, but ſuch was the care and skill of the Chriſtian Engineers, that they with their great ſhot diſmounted divers of them, overthrowing their battery, and burying ſuch as were there poſted in their ruins, yet having made two breaches in the wall, one near the red Tower, and the other not far from the Imperial Pallace, he commanded five thouſand <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other ſouldiers to enter the Breach, but

            <p>Things being at this paſs, the Duke of <hi>Loraine</hi> in his Camp where he lay had notice that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy

            <p>The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, having raiſed an Army of thirteen or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand men, for the ſervice of the Empire, after having muſtered them in the preſence of the Emperor, cauſed them to march directly towards <hi>Kremps,</hi> to joyn the Imperial Forces, reſolving in perſon to follow them with all convenient ſpeed, when in the mean while General <hi>Dunwalt,</hi> having notice that ſeven or eight thouſand of the enemy were fallen into the upper <hi>Auſtria,</hi> he ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with what Forces he could, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all diligence to oppoſe their progreſs, in which they made ſuch devaſtation that the like had not been formerly known, and ſuch was his good ſucceſs, that coming upon them at unawares, he put them to the rout, killing a great many of them, and reſcuing two thouſand Captive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whom they had taken in their progreſs, as alſo recovered a great booty.</p>
            <p>Upon notice of theſe and the like ſucceſſes the Imperial Confederates haſtned their quotaes to joyn the Army, and for that purpoſe a Conference was held at <hi>Hasford</hi> on the 27 of <hi>July</hi> between the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Bamberg</hi> and <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Hanſpatch, Bereith, &amp;c.</hi> wherein it was reſolved that the Troops of <hi>Franconia,</hi> deſigned for the aſiſtance of the Emperor ſhould ſet forward on the ſecond of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and that the Biſhop and Chapter of <hi>Wirtz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> ſhould for this ſervice furniſh out two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of foot, and that four Companies of the Guards of the Elector of <hi>Brandenbxrg,</hi> over and

            <p>During theſe tranſactions the Turks inceſſantly Battered the City of <hi>Vienna,</hi> labouring earneſtly in their works, as being greatly deſirous to take it by ſtorm, and more eſpecially to ſave the Grand Viſiers oath, who had ſworn by the head of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to take it or dye under the walls, though afterward it appeared he had not ſtrength enough to acquire the former, nor courage ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to keep his word in the latter, for ſuch was the courage of the beſieged, that ſallying they beat the enemy once more out of all their works, but by the former ſallies and ſickneſs as before mentioned, they were exceedingly weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, inſomuch that they deſpaired much longer to maintain the City, againſt the aſſaults of ſuch ſo numerous and reſtleſs enemies, ſo that on the fourth of <hi>September</hi> Count <hi>Staremberg</hi> at the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt intreaty of the <hi>Burghers,</hi> cauſed it to be ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from St. <hi>Stephens</hi> Tower by ſetting up a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſlag, the ſignal appointed that the City was in

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:57574:22"/>and <hi>Saxony</hi> (attended by their Guards) By the Count <hi>d' Staremberg</hi> moſt of the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, Magiſtrates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Garriſon Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers being poſted on the Baſtion as they were during the Siege, the Burghers in Arms, and all the Cannon round the Town thrice diſcharged, where his Imperial Majeſty paſſing on took a view of the Baſtion and other works, ruined during the Siege, and the ſeveral Retrenchments the beſieged had made within the Town, and ſo went to St. <hi>Stephens</hi> Church, where <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung, after which he went to the Arch Dukes Pallace (his own being ſo much indamaged by the enemies Cannon, that it was not capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him) where he gave Publick Audience, and in the evening the Duke of <hi>Loraine</hi> arrived, and was by the Emperor received in a moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging manner, and had a long Conference with him relating to the preſent war, at what time the King of <hi>Poland</hi> ſent his under Chancelor in his name to congratulate his Arrival, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Imperial Standard, richly Imbroidered and ſet with precious Stones, to a great value, the which together with two horſe-tailes the uſual ſignals of war amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> he found in the Viſiers Tent; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the original Copy of a Letter ſigned by divers <hi>Hungarian</hi> Lords, wherein they congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate the Viſier upon the ſucceſſeful progreſſe of his Arms, and encouraged him to undertake the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and withal the Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor had it in charge to invite his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty into his maſters Camp.</p>
            <p>The day following the Emperor left the City
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57574:22"/>and went to viſit the Army, which was encamped about 2 miles from thence, the two wings reaching towards <hi>Ebersdorf</hi> and <hi>Laxemborough,</hi> when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt to the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Troops, the Elector at the head of them, ſaluted him with his ſword, and having performed his complements, accompanied him to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Camp, where the King had drawn up his Army in Battalia, at the head of which, attended by the Great Marſhal, and divers Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators of <hi>Poland,</hi> he advanced to meet the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, each approached the other on horſeback, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing all poſſible demonſtration of Reciprocal love and friendſhip, and after a ſhort interview, the Emperor took a view of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, and then returned to <hi>Vienna,</hi> whereupon the King of <hi>Poland</hi> decamped, and marched to <hi>Wiſcha,</hi> and was followed by the Imperial Troops under the Leading of the Duke of <hi>Loraine,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the Electors of <hi>Bavaria, Saxony,</hi> &amp;c. reſolving to ſtrip the <hi>Turk</hi> out of his Garriſons in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and now the Emperor, as a ſignal of his love and reſpect to Count <hi>Staremberg,</hi> made him great maſter d' Camp, and the Magiſtrates of <hi>Vienna</hi> attributing their preſervation next Heaven, to his courage and conduct, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of ſo great ſervice, made him a preſent of two thouſand Ducates, and by a Publick act under their ſeal, freed his houſe for ever of all Taxations or other duties, to the payment of which it before was lyable.</p>
            <p>The Grand Viſier by this time, having conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and well weighed the greatneſſe of his loſs, and the exceſſive expence his maſter had been at, in Levying and maintaining ſo vaſt an Army,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57574:23"/>the conduct of which himſelf had undertaken' promiſing at his ſetting out no leſs then the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of <hi>Auſtria, Croatia, Sileſia</hi> and <hi>Moravia,</hi> and now defeated without acquiring any thing memorable, he greatly fearing his head muſt pay the price of his preſumption; the better to caſt the blame upon another, and thereby frame a plauſible excuſe, he in a great rage ſent to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle the Baſſa of <hi>Buda,</hi> which was performed in his Tent, the Viſier laying to his charge, that he had baſely and Cowardly ſuffered the overthrow of thoſe Forces he was conducting to the Camp, and had not afterwards taken timely care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crait his Forces, nor ſend proviſion and other neceſſaries to the Camp. This Baſſa thus made away, one <hi>Hamet Chellif</hi> was made Baſſa in his ſtead, but long enjoyed not his honour, for at the fight at <hi>Barkan</hi> he with divers other Baſſas, was ſlain, as in the ſequel of this Hiſtory will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>The Viſier having notice that the Chriſtian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had entred <hi>Hungary,</hi> with a reſolution to ſet down before ſome important place, and that the Generals had eye upon <hi>Gran</hi> and <hi>New-Haſſel,</hi> he collected his ſcattered Forces, to the number of twenty five thouſand, encamping near the walls of <hi>Stoel-Weiſſenburg,</hi> but not thinking himſelf ſafe there, retired before the Chriſtian Army, which marched with all diligence to find him out, but the King and Duke having notice that the lower <hi>Hungary</hi> was intirely ruined, and left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, they repaſſed the <hi>Danube</hi> near <hi>Comora,</hi> with a reſolution to poſſeſſe themſelves of <hi>Barkan,</hi>

But this letted not the progreſs of their Arms, for the King of <hi>Poland</hi> by ſwift marches advancing a <hi>German</hi> mile and a half be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Imperial Army, coming near <hi>Barkan,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> came out in ſmall parties, to skirmiſh with whom, and to attack the Garriſon, the King cauſed his Dragoons to alight, who after ſome diſpute cauſed the enemy to retire, but their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat proved only a deſign to draw the <hi>Poles</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Ambuſh, for whilſt the King furiouſly purſued, ſix thouſand <hi>Janizaries</hi> paſſing undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered behind a hill, charged the Kings Battle ſo ſtrongly in the Flank, that piercing the Array, they put it into ſome diſorder, the horſe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the King was preſent, breaking rank and giving ground, yet wheeling off he ſoon brought them to recover their order, and continued the fight bloody and doubtful, when being ſeconded by foot, the <hi>Turks</hi> were ſlain in great numbers, and about to fly, had they not been reinforced by two thouſand horſe, brought on by the Baſſa of <hi>Buda,</hi> who in the firſt charge was himſelf flain, yet they obſtinately maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fight, which making the King doubt that the Viſier with a greater power was at hand, as having no certain intelligence of his march, he ſent an expreſs to the Duke of <hi>Loraine</hi> to let him
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57574:24"/>know he was engaged, and to deſire him to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance with all convenient ſpeed, which he did, but not with ſuch celerity as was expected, by reaſon he had a long defile to paſs, but upon the firſt approach of his Troops the <hi>Poles</hi> retired, to avoid the confuſion they were falling into, but being reinforced by ſix Regiments of Imperial Dragoons, they again returned in good order, and every where put the <hi>Turks</hi> to the rout, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the execution to the Bridge of <hi>Barkan,</hi> over which a few made their eſcape, but the Bridge once broken, and all hope of flight cut off, they reſolutely threw themſelves into the River, and their periſhed, ſo that of the whole body a very ſmall number eſcaped the ſword and drowning, unleſs eight hundred that were taken Priſoners, amongſt whom was the Baſſa of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtria,</hi> and the Baſſas of <hi>Buda</hi> and <hi>Aleppo,</hi> fell amongſt the ſlain, which were not computed leſs then ten thouſand, upon which defeat the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſurrendred upon diſcretion, in which was found a rich booty, containing part of the ſpoils of <hi>Auſtria, Croatia</hi> and <hi>Moravia;</hi> In this Battle fought on the 9 of <hi>October</hi> thirteen hundred <hi>Poles,</hi> and one hundred Imperialiſts fell, the King himſelf was much indangered by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhot, and Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> his ſon had his horſe ſhot under him; none of note being killed on the part of the Chriſtians but <hi>Kirotski</hi> a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Palatine.</p>
            <p>This ſecond overthrow greatly diſcouraged the Viſier, who was advancing to joyne this body, but upon the news of the defeat he in great perplexity retired to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> there to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect new ſupplyes, whilſt the King and Duke
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57574:24"/>after thanks for this unexpected Victory return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Almighty God, kept on their way to <hi>Gran,</hi> beating the ſtragling partyes appointed to let their paſſage, and on the 18 of <hi>October</hi> coming near the City ſent out a commanded party to burn the Suburbs, the which after a hot diſpute which ſuch <hi>Turks</hi> as ſallyed to prevent it, in part they performed, and thereupon prepared form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to beſiege that important Garriſon, which no doubt will fall into their hands.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Tekely</hi> finding the <hi>ottoman</hi> ſword too feeble to maintain his uſurped Title, and ſupport him in his Rebellion, ſent his deputies to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> earneſtly to implore his mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Emperor to pardon his paſt offences, and accept of his future obedience, but that king not finding him real in his intentions, refuſed to meddle in that affair.</p>
            <p>And thus much Reader have I thought fit for your ſatisfaction impartially to recount, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with my hearty prayers to Almighty God, that as the Chriſtian Arms have been of late ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſo may they continue till the haughty Infidels by ſad experience know, that the crucified God, whom they impiouſly contemn, blaſpheme and revile, is not only able to deliver his people from their mercileſs cruelties, but in his juſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to break in pieces their aſpiring Monarchy with a Rod of Iron.</p>
